However, the error of the integrated navigation system gradually diverges due to the inevitable velocity measurement error of DVL when GNSS outages occur. To ensure the high navigational accuracy and stability of SINS, it is necessary to dynamically adjust the damping state of SINS provided externally. In this paper, we have developed a novel method for damping state switching based on machine learning with SINS. We construct a model of the change in reference velocity error and use sliding window technology to obtain the reference velocity error for model training. Before training, the digital compass loop is designed to process and highlight the change in reference velocity change errors. In order to reduce the impact of the damping switching, a variable damping system is used to transform the traditional one-time switching of the damping coefficient into a gradual switching, effectively reducing the impact of a sudden change in the damping coefficient on the system. Simulation experiments and tests on ships show that the proposed method effectively reduces the overshoot error integrated underwater during state switching.

Geographically weighted regression (GWR) is a common method for satellite-based bathymetry estimation. However, in sediment-laden water environments, especially ports, the suspended materials significantly affect the performance of GWR for depth inversion. This study proposes a novel approach that integrates GWR with Random Forest (RF) techniques, using longitude, latitude, and multispectral remote sensing reflectance as input variables. This approach effectively addresses the challenge of estimating bathymetry in turbid waters by considering the strong correlation between water depth and geographical location.

The warming effect of anthropogenic greenhouse gases has been partially balanced by the cooling effect of anthropogenic aerosols. In 2020, fuel regulations abruptly reduced the emission of sulfur dioxide from international shipping by about 80% and created an inadvertent geoengineering termination shock with global impact. Here we estimate the regulation leads to a radiative forcing of +0.2±0.11Wm−2 averaged over the global ocean. The amount of radiative forcing could lead to a doubling (or more) of the warming rate in the 2020 s compared with the rate since 1980 with strong spatiotemporal heterogeneity. The warming effect is consistent with the recent observed strong warming in 2023 and expected to make the 2020 s anomalously warm. The forcing is equivalent in magnitude to 80% of the measured increase in planetary heat uptake since 2020. The radiative forcing also has strong hemispheric contrast, which has important implications for precipitation pattern changes. Our result suggests marine cloud brightening may be a viable geoengineering method in temporarily cooling the climate that has its unique challenges due to inherent spatiotemporal heterogeneity.Shipping fuel regulations in 2020 that reduced sulfur dioxide emissions by 80% led to substantial warming over parts of the oceans, according to simulations with Earth system, machine learning, and energy balance models, suggesting a termination shock after marine cloud geoengineering could be severe.","https://www.proquest.com/docview/3062310764?accountid=44943&bdid=84593&_bd=L4PKyIp1OpWtnn1r3HKvJ9yEgsU%3D","https://doi.org/10.1038/s43247-024-01442-3"

Different ship types significantly impact acceleration, steering performance, and stopping distance, thus making precise identification of unfamiliar ship types crucial for maritime monitoring. This study introduces an original classification study based on AIS data for cargo ships, presenting a classifier tailored for bulk carriers, containers, general cargo, and vehicle carriers. The model’s efficacy was tested within the Changhua Wind Farm Channel using eight classification algorithms across tree-structure-based, proximity-based, and regression-based categories and employing standard metrics (Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score) to assess the performance. The results show that tree-structure-based algorithms, particularly XGBoost and Random Forest, demonstrated superior performance. This study also implemented a feature selection strategy with five methods, revealing that a model trained with only four features (three ship-geometric features and one trajectory behavior feature) can achieve high accuracy. Conclusively, the classifier effectively overcame the challenges of limited AIS data labels, achieving a classification accuracy of 97% for ships in the Changhua Wind Farm Channel. These results are pivotal in identifying abnormal ship behavior, highlighting the classifier’s potential for maritime monitoring applications.","https://www.proquest.com/docview/2912662210?accountid=44943&bdid=84593&_bd=gGf%2Bih5Ij%2B04GS%2FTArrDkS7b9XA%3D","https://doi.org/10.3390/electronics13010098"

The utilization of ammonia and liquid hydrogen propulsion in a carbon-free propulsion system is a promising option to achieve net-zero emission in the maritime supply chain. Meanwhile, optimal ship voyage planning is a candidate to reduce carbon emissions immediately without new buildings and retrofits of the alternative fuel-based propulsion system. Due to the voyage options, the precise prediction of fuel consumption and carbon emission via voyage operation profile optimization is a prerequisite for carbon emission reduction. This paper proposes a novel fuel consumption and carbon emission quantity prediction method which is based on the onboard measurement data of a smart ship. The prediction performance of the proposed method was investigated and compared to machine learning and LSTM-model-based fuel consumption and gas emission prediction methods. The results had an accuracy of 81.5% in diesel mode and 91.2% in gas mode. The SHAP (Shapley additive explanations) model, an XAI (Explainable Artificial Intelligence), and a CO2 consumption model were employed to identify the major factors used in the predictions. The accuracy of the fuel consumption calculated using flow meter data, as opposed to power load data, improved by approximately 21.0%.

However, en-route factors like weather conditions or piracy incidents often delay scheduled arrivals at destination ports, leading to downstream inefficiencies. Due to the maritime industry’s digital transformation, smart ports and vessels generate vast amounts of data, creating an opportunity to use the latest technologies, like machine and deep learning (ML/DL), to support terminals in their operations. This study proposes a data-driven solution for accurately predicting vessel arrival times using ML/DL techniques, including Deep Neural Networks, K-Nearest Neighbors, Decision Trees, Random Forest, and Extreme Gradient Boosting. This study collects real-world AIS data in the Eastern Mediterranean Sea from a network of public and private AIS base stations. The most relevant features are selected for training and evaluating the six ML/DL models. A comprehensive comparison is also performed against the estimated arrival time provided by shipping agents, a simple calculation-based approach, and four other ML/DL models proposed recently in the literature.

Like other domains in the energy sector, the wind energy domain is continuing to digitalize its systems by embracing Industry 4.0 technologies such as the Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT), virtualization, and edge computing to monitor and manage its critical infrastructure remotely. Adopting these technologies creates dynamic, scalable, and cost-effective data-acquisition systems. At the heart of these data-acquisition systems is a communication network that facilitates data transfer between communicating nodes. Given the challenges of configuring, managing, and troubleshooting large-scale communication networks, this review paper explores the adoption of the state-of-the-art software-defined networking (SDN) and network function virtualization (NFV) technologies in the design of next-generation offshore wind farm IIoT–Edge communication networks. While SDN and NFV technologies present a promising solution to address the challenges of these large-scale communication networks, this paper discusses the SDN/NFV-related performance, security, reliability, and scalability concerns, highlighting current mitigation strategies. Building on these mitigation strategies, the concept of resilience (that is, the ability to recover from component failures, attacks, and service interruptions) is given special attention. The paper highlights the self-X (self-configuring, self-healing, and self-optimizing) approaches that build resilience in the software-defined IIoT–Edge communication network architectures. These resilience approaches enable the network to autonomously adjust its configuration, self-repair during stochastic failures, and optimize performance in response to changing conditions. The paper concludes that resilient software-defined IIoT–Edge communication networks will play a big role in guaranteeing seamless next-generation offshore wind farm operations by facilitating critical, latency-sensitive data transfers.","https://www.proquest.com/docview/3072322146?accountid=44943&bdid=84593&_bd=srKQLq4OCDLhkkQ7WACOpg42jz0%3D","https://doi.org/10.3390/en17122897"

The status of inactive watch officers, such as fatigued driving and negligence on lookout, is one of the main causes of accidents. Intelligent technology for real-time perception and state evaluation of ship OOWs significantly reduces accidents caused by human factors. The traditional computer vision method is difficult to adapt to the complex environment of a ship bridge, and carries strong privacy risks. With the development of Internet of Things technology, sensing technology based on ubiquitous Wi-Fi devices provides a new way to accurately monitor the status of ship OOWs. In this paper, we use commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) Wi-Fi devices to propose a ship driving activity state detection method based on beamforming feedback information (BFI). Using wireless sensing data to sense the number of OOWs and their driving behavior realizes low-cost and high-precision detection of the behavioral status of the ship’s bridge watchkeeper. Experiments were conducted in a ship-driving simulation laboratory and on a real-world Yangtze River cruise ship.

The Shanghai Containerized Freight Index (SCFI), a leading indicator of the shipping industry's health, is particularly sensitive to the vicissitudes of the Chinese commodity futures sector. Nevertheless, a significant research gap exists regarding the application of Chinese commodity futures prices as predictive tools for the SCFI. To address this gap, the present study employs a comprehensive dataset spanning daily observations from March 24, 2017, to May 27, 2022, encompassing a total of 29,308 data points. We have crafted an innovative deep learning model that synergistically combines Long ShortTerm Memory (LSTM) and Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architectures. The outcomes show that the CNN-LSTM model does a great job of finding the nonlinear dynamics in the SCFI dataset and accurately capturing its long-term temporal dependencies. The model can handle changes in random sample selection, data frequency, and structural shifts within the dataset. It achieved an impressive R2 of 96.6% and did better than the LSTM and CNN models that were used alone.

As an example of this, maritime accidents are one of the most recognised international problems, with clear environmental and human life consequences. From the beginning, statistical studies have shown that not only the typical sampled variables must be considered but the accidents are related to human factors that, at the same time, are related to some variables like fatigue that cannot be easily sampled. In this research work, the use of machine learning algorithms on over 300 maritime accidents is proposed to identify the relationship between human factors and the main variables. The results showed that compliance with the minimum crew members and ship length are the two most relevant variables related to each accident for the Spanish Search and Rescue (SAR) region, as well as the characteristics of the ships. These accidents could be understood as three main groups of accidents related to the general tendency to not meet the minimum number of crew members and its difference in the year of construction of the ship. Finally, it was possible to use neural networks to model accidents with sufficient accuracy (determination factor higher than 0.60), which is particularly interesting in the context of a control system for maritime transport.","https://www.proquest.com/docview/3097819778?accountid=44943&bdid=84593&_bd=nGx5eiVWXrwiSEydp961i7Zaoyc%3D","https://doi.org/10.3390/app14167239"

Digital Twins have been in use in production and logistics to increase flexibility in operations and to support operational decision-making based on real-time information. However, the true potential of Digital Twins to enhance terminal operations still needs to be further investigated. A Delphi study is conducted to explore the operational pain points, the best practices to counter them, and how these best practices can be supported by Digital Twins.

The channel model is verified by channel measurements on the sea and the land which have been analyzed and integrated into a software tool that is provided along with this publication. The key difference between channel models for maritime and land-based services is the constantly changing sea surface. This results in varying reflection conditions such as changing reflectors and scatterer on the sea surface. In addition, the motion conditions of the transmitter and receiver on the ship change in all three dimensions depending on the sea state. The collected data of several measurement campaigns in different areas were used to analyze the propagation conditions over the sea by varying the sea surface roughness, the antenna heights, and the used bandwidths used, as well as the additional propagation conditions over the nearby land. The influence of the changing antenna height on the ship due to the sea conditions affects the reflection and scattering conditions.

However, the traditional manual scheduling used for mining transportation often prioritizes output over efficiency and quality, resulting in high operational expenses, traffic jams, and long lines. In this study, a novel scheduling model with multi-objective optimization was created to overcome these problems. Production, demand, ore grade, and vehicle count were the model’s constraints. The optimization goals were to minimize the shipping cost, total waiting time, and ore grade deviation. An enhanced multi-objective beluga whale optimization (IMOBWO) algorithm was implemented in the model. The algorithm’s superior performance was demonstrated in ten test functions, as well as the IEEE 30-bus system. It was enhanced by optimizing the population initialization, improving the adaptive factor, and adding dynamic domain perturbation. The case analysis showed that, in comparison to the other three conventional multi-objective algorithms, IMOBWO reduced the shipping cost from 7.65 to 0.84%, the total waiting time from 35.7 to 7.54%, and the ore grade deviation from 14.8 to 3.73%. The implementation of this algorithm for truck scheduling in open-pit mines increased operational efficiency, decreased operating costs, and advanced intelligent mine construction and transportation systems.

Traditional methods often rely on collision risk assessments, using quantitative indicators like the Distance to the Closest Point of Approach (DCPA) and the Time to the Closest Point of Approach (TCPA). Ship Officers on Watch (OOWs) are required to execute avoidance maneuvers once these indicators reach or exceed preset safety thresholds. However, the effectiveness of these indicators is limited by uncertainties in the maritime environment and the human behaviors of OOWs. To address these limitations, this study introduces a machine learning method to learn collision avoidance behavior from empirical data of ship collision avoidance, particularly in cross-encounter situations. The research utilizes Automatic Identification System (AIS) data from the open waters around Ningbo Zhoushan Port. After data preprocessing and applying spatio-temporal constraints, this study identifies ship trajectory pairs in crossing scenarios and calculates their relative motion parameters. The Douglas–Peucker algorithm is used to identify the timing of ship collision avoidance actions and a collision avoidance decision dataset is constructed. The Random Forest algorithm was then used to analyze the factors affecting the timing of collision avoidance, and six key factors were identified: the distance, relative speed, relative bearing, DCPA, TCPA, and the ratio of the lengths of the giving-way and stand-on ships. These factors serve as inputs for the XGBoost algorithm model, which is enhanced with Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO), and thus constructing a ship collision avoidance decision model. In addition, considering the inherent errors in any model and the dynamic nature of the ship collision avoidance process, an action time window for collision avoidance is introduced, which provides a more flexible time range for ships to make timely collision avoidance responses based on actual conditions and the specific encounter environment. This model provides OOWs with accurate timing for taking collision avoidance decisions. Case studies have validated the practicality and effectiveness of this model, offering new theoretical foundations and practical guidance for maritime collision avoidance.","https://www.proquest.com/docview/3067521935?accountid=44943&bdid=84593&_bd=RpH%2BrseflzWlAkGh2hiFJO31SMg%3D","https://doi.org/10.3390/su16114626"

The methodology combines secondary sources with primary data from 42 expert interviews, a 28 respondent survey, and two maritime security roundtables. Key findings were that ships’ critical systems are increasingly interconnected, yet aging IT infrastructure and minimal cybersecurity awareness among crews heighten risks. Meanwhile, regional terrorist groups have previously targeted shipping and shown considerable skill in exploiting online tools, aligning with broader calls for jihadist violence. Furthermore, opportunistic piracy persists in the SOMS with the potential to disrupt shipping. Experts confirmed that maritime cybersecurity lags behind other critical infrastructure sectors and needs updated governance. Initial International Maritime Organization (IMO) guidelines lack specificity but revisions and updated IMO guidance are in process, while Port state implementation of maritime cybersecurity standards varies. Crucially, information sharing remains inadequate, even as recorded attacks increase. Findings underscore that although major hybrid incidents have not occurred, simulations and threat actors’ capabilities demonstrate potential for catastrophic collisions or cascading disruption in congested waterways. Mitigating factors like redundancy and crew training are deficient currently. Some alignment between SOMS states on maritime security cooperation exists, but not on cyber threats specifically.

Conclusions: To address these challenges, the study proposes a four-stage empirically grounded DT strategy framework that guides both practitioners and policymakers through DT endeavors. The framework includes: (1) the port’s value chain mapping, (2) stakeholder engagement, (3) resource mobilization, and (4) effective monitoring. For scholars, we provide an avenue for testing statistical significance of association and causality among the identified challenges.","https://www.proquest.com/docview/3072370192?accountid=44943&bdid=84593&_bd=EEVS%2BC8qxMEMKHIZVz3FpyRtqr4%3D","https://doi.org/10.3390/logistics8020051"

However, the trustworthiness of both the digital twins and datasets must be assured. This study aims at developing a framework to assure the trustworthiness of marine engines DTs based on first-principle models. This framework considers the phases of the DT development, progressivity, and trustworthiness assurance, the latter being based on three steps, namely validation, verification, and robustness. Subsequently, a methodology is applied to develop the DT of a marine engine for healthy conditions, which is extended to represent a wider operating envelope considering systematically identified anomalies. The results demonstrate that the developed DT trustworthiness is assured, as the validation step provided errors within ±3%, the verification step provided sound trade-offs, whereas the robustness assessment step confirmed acceptable uncertainty ratios. Subsequently, the DT is employed to generate datasets required for developing a data-driven model for anomaly diagnosis, which exhibits an accuracy of 98.8% for anomaly detection, 97.6% for anomaly identification, and 90.1–91.8% for anomaly isolation.

Since physical models often face challenges in comprehensively accounting for factors influencing glacial melt and uncertainties in inputs, machine learning (ML) offers a viable alternative due to its robust flexibility and nonlinear fitting capability. However, the effectiveness of ML in modeling GMB data across diverse glacier types within High Mountain Asia has not yet been thoroughly explored. This study addresses this research gap by evaluating ML models used for the simulation of annual glacier-wide GMB data, with a specific focus on comparing maritime glaciers in the Niyang River basin and continental glaciers in the Manas River basin. For this purpose, meteorological predictive factors derived from monthly ERA5-Land datasets, and topographical predictive factors obtained from the Randolph Glacier Inventory, along with target GMB data rooted in geodetic mass balance observations, were employed to drive four selective ML models: the random forest model, the gradient boosting decision tree (GBDT) model, the deep neural network model, and the ordinary least-square linear regression model. The results highlighted that ML models generally exhibit superior performance in the simulation of GMB data for continental glaciers compared to maritime ones. Moreover, among the four ML models, the GBDT model was found to consistently exhibit superior performance with coefficient of determination (R2) values of 0.72 and 0.67 and root mean squared error (RMSE) values of 0.21 m w.e. and 0.30 m w.e. for glaciers within Manas and Niyang river basins, respectively. Furthermore, this study reveals that topographical and climatic factors differentially influence GMB simulations in maritime and continental glaciers, providing key insights into glacier dynamics in response to climate change. In summary, ML, particularly the GBDT model, demonstrates significant potential in GMB simulation. Moreover, the application of ML can enhance the accuracy of GMB modeling, providing a promising approach to assess the impacts of climate change on glacier dynamics.","https://www.proquest.com/docview/3003410684?accountid=44943&bdid=84593&_bd=%2B8jRnZz1uOJtACD12TAikJHSqa8%3D","https://doi.org/10.3390/rs16060956"

With increasing emission reduction initiatives, such as the European Union's incorporation of the maritime sector into the emissions trading system, both challenges and opportunities emerge for maritime transport and associated industries. To address these concerns, this study presents a model specifically designed for estimating and projecting the spatiotemporal GHG emission inventory of ships, particularly when dealing with incomplete automatic identification system datasets. In the computational aspect of the model, various data processing techniques are employed to rectify inaccuracies arising from incomplete or erroneous AIS data, including big data cleaning, ship trajectory aggregation, multi-source spatiotemporal data fusion and missing data complementation. Utilizing a bottom-up ship dynamic approach, the model generates a high-resolution GHG emission inventory. This inventory contains key attributes such as the types of ships emitting GHGs, the locations of these emissions, the time periods during which emissions occur, and emissions. For predictive analytics, the model utilizes temporal fusion transformers equipped with the attention mechanism to accurately forecast the critical emission parameters, including emission locations, time frames, and quantities. Focusing on the sea area around Tianjin port-a region characterized by high shipping activity-this study achieves fine-grained emission source tracking via detailed emission inventory calculations. Moreover, the prediction model achieves a promising loss function of approximately 0.15 under the optimal parameter configuration, obtaining a better result than recurrent neural network (RNN) and long short-term memory network (LSTM) in the comparative experiments. The proposed method allows for a comprehensive understanding of emission patterns across diverse vessel types under various operational conditions.

However, few works have addressed the extensive and objective evaluation of the proposed approaches. In this paper, a standard-aligned evaluation methodology is presented and empirically conducted to evaluate a newly proposed cyber risk assessment approach for CPSs.

As expected, the main challenge in providing 5G connectivity on the sea is to provide coverage over large areas of open water. Thus, as a starting point, this paper presents a measurement campaign that was conducted to assess the current coverage in the Baltic Sea, which concluded that the current terrestrial networks cannot guarantee sufficient coverage. Next, the solution architecture and trials proposed by 5G-ROUTES are described, which are based on the integration of satellite and leading-edge multi-hop connectivity in 5G networks. Utilizing satellite backhaul can potentially overcome the connectivity challenge from the terrestrial domain to the maritime domain, while multi-hop connectivity ensures that coverage is extended among the different ships that are navigating the sea. Furthermore, this paper describes how the project will evaluate, in field trials tailored to this maritime environment, common connectivity key performance indicators (KPIs) such as latency, throughput, availability and reliability.

One such novel application is the modernization of maritime communications. Effective maritime communication is vital for ensuring the safety of crew members, vessels, and cargo. The maritime industry is responsible for the transportation of a significant portion of global trade, and as such, the efficient and secure transfer of information is essential to maintain the flow of goods and services. With the increasing complexity of maritime operations, technological advancements such as unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs), and the Internet of Ships (IoS) have been introduced to enhance communication and operational efficiency. However, these technologies also bring new challenges in terms of security and network management. Compromised IT systems, with escalated privileges, can potentially enable easy and ready access to operational technology (OT) systems and networks with the same privileges, with an increased risk of zero-day attacks. In this paper, we first provide a review of the current state and modalities of maritime communications. We then review the current adoption of software-defined radios (SDRs) and software-defined networks (SDNs) in the maritime industry and evaluate their impact as maritime IoT enablers.

In particular, artificial intelligence-based object recognition technologies are being widely applied to the development of intelligent analysis services based on image data and streaming video data. As such, in the port yard, these object recognition technologies are being used to develop port safety services in smart ports. Accidents are a frequent occurrence in port yards due to misaligned loading of ship containers. In order to prevent such accidents, various studies using artificial intelligence technology are underway. In this paper, we propose a real-time shipping container accident inference edge system that can analyze the ship container’s loading status from a safety point of view to prevent accidents in advance. The proposed system includes the collection of video data of the ship container, inferring the safety level of the alignment status of the ship container, and transmitting the inference results for the safety level. In this paper, the proposed inference model is implemented with YOLOv3, YOLOv4 and YOLOv7 networks and can be used in video monitoring to realize the accurate classification and positioning of three different safety levels (safe, caution, and danger) in real time. In the performance evaluation, the detection accuracy of the inference model implemented with the YOLOv4 network was greater than 0.95. Its performance was also significantly better than that of the inference model implemented with the YOLOv3 and YOLOv7 networks. Although it was slightly inferior to the YOLOv4 network in terms of the accuracy, the inference model implemented with the YOLOv3 network had a faster inference speed than the model implemented with the YOLOv4 and YOLOv7 networks.

However, the issue of how to mitigate the consequences of accidents involving autonomous ships has not been sufficiently addressed. Therefore, this study focuses on alternative design solutions and emergency response systems for MASS to properly control emergency situations and minimize the impact of accidents, such as flooding and fire on board. The goal is to efficiently address such accidents, especially in situations where the number of people on board is significantly reduced or the ship is being operated automatically or remotely, and to promptly detect and respond to such situations from a remote location. This paper investigates the possibility of modifying the design of the air conditioning system to delay flooding by considering a reduction in the number of crew members in order to prevent flooding. To prevent the spread of fire, the study examines early blockage measures for areas where air can enter.

Then, the photographic information of each of these pigs is applied to a predictive model machine-learned in advance to determine whether or not there are candidate pigs for determining the presence or absence of abdominal fat-forming pigs. And if there is a candidate pig, it is determined using a machine-learning model for predicting whether the candidate pig is an abdominal fat-forming pig by analyzing the pattern of weight increase of the abdominal fat-forming pig and changes in weight of a candidate. If the candidate pig is an abdominal fat-forming pig, the timing of shipping is determined by predicting when the weight of the candidate pigs, specifically the abdominal fat-forming pigs, will reach a predetermined minimum shipping weight. This prediction is made using a machine-learning model that considers the weight gain trend pattern of abdominal fat-forming pigs and tracks changes in the weight of the candidate pig. A machine-learning model is used to predict the timing of weight gain in candidate pigs, specifically those that develop abdominal fat, in order to determine the optimal shipping time.

From the literature, it is evident that the practical determination of the center of lateral resistance is still unknown.

According to the results of the experimental study, the author found that the model from FlowSimulation has a clearer picture, but for FlowSimulation this is the limit of possibilities, and for the machine learning system there is the possibility of further development to improve the image. In the future, the author intends to continue experiments on training the model in order to obtain a better image.","https://www.proquest.com/docview/2881389528?accountid=44943&bdid=84593&_bd=IE%2FD20hnO7isBVvCOfKI%2FkBp9Ug%3D","https://doi.org/10.1088/1742-6596/2612/1/012004"

Current exercises for port services still lack performance profiling for arriving vessels regarding their arrival punctuality and compliance with port resource schedule for Just-in-time (JIT) service, as well as their efforts contributing towards less emission through reduced turnaround time within port. As a result, a performance-based incentive is missing. Bringing in the incentive component may facilitate the objectives of achieving both port efficiency and sustainability. Blockchain technology, owning to its intrinsic features like immutability, traceability, governance and provenance, and in-built tokens (for most public chain platforms), allow for the establishment of system solutions to record key performance indicators (KPIs) and distribute incentives to good performers. This paper is the first to propose a blockchain-based system to incentivize JIT and green operations in ports. The platform system design and operating mechanisms are elaborated in detail, and a prototype system has been implemented based on the Solana blockchain to demonstrate the core features. The current system’s potential is substantial, considering the industry’s increasing awareness about its environmental footprint. Continuous developments can be facilitated by connecting to market-based measures such as carbon pricing and emission trading in the maritime sector.","https://www.proquest.com/docview/2893356960?accountid=44943&bdid=84593&_bd=jMSwUgD0sySgKn2za0HF0H5gBsQ%3D","https://doi.org/10.3390/su152215686"

In short, the Blue Economy encompasses classic sectors such as shipbuilding together with more innovative concepts in the ports, such as digitalization, innovation, or energy transition. In this research, a new tool is developed which, as its main objective, can obtain a degree of implementation of the dimensions of the Blue Economy in Spanish ports through the evaluation of each of the economic sectors that constitute the B.E. in the 28 Spanish port authorities. To this end, a Delphi panel has been used to determine the importance of each economic dimension, a database has also been generated to determine the state of development of these dimensions in each port, and some equations have been developed to determine in base 100 how developed each port is.

Smart ships and reducing ship greenhouse gas emissions are among the most actively researched topics in the maritime transport industry. Owing to the massive advances in information and communications technology, the internet of things, and big data technologies, smart ships have emerged as a very promising proposition. Numerous methodologies and network architectures can smoothly collect data from ships that are currently in operation, as is currently done in research on reducing ship fuel consumption by deep learning or conventional methods. Many extensive studies of stacked autoencoders have been carried out in the past few years. However, prior studies have not addressed the development of algorithms or deep learning-based models to classify the operating states of ships. In this paper, we propose for the first time a deep learning-based stacked autoencoder model that can classify the operating state of a ship broadly into the categories of At Sea, Stand By, and In Port, using actual ship power load data. In order to maximize the model’s performance, the stacked autoencoder architecture, number of hidden layers, and number of neurons contained in each layer were measured by performance metrics such as true positive rate, false positive rate, Matthews correlation coefficient, and accuracy. It was found that the model’s performance was not always improved by increasing its complexity, so the feasibility of developing and utilizing an efficient model was verified by comparing it to real data. The best-performing model had a (5–128) structure with latent layer size 9. It achieved a true positive rate of 0.9035, a false positive rate of 0.0541, a Matthews correlation coefficient of 0.9054, and an accuracy of 0.9612, clearly demonstrating that deep learning can be used to analyze ship operating modes.","https://www.proquest.com/docview/2812387167?accountid=44943&bdid=84593&_bd=3HH9RCimjKeOa8xWkIrQxSGHH4w%3D","https://doi.org/10.3390/app13095491"

This research paper investigates the strategies customers use to balance convenience and cost. It notes that consumers often divide their purchases, choosing online platforms for items they perceive as reasonably priced, while preferring physical stores for products associated with high shipping costs, lack of express shipping, or higher online prices. Traditional retail analysis methods, such as identifying frequently purchased and co-occurring items, are critical to the sector. However, these insights may be skewed if the analysis is solely confined to the online shopping cart, neglecting related purchases made at physical stores either before or after the online transaction. This paper addresses this analytical gap by looking into the complex interplay between online and offline purchases. The objective is to provide a more comprehensive, detailed understanding of multi-channel shopping behaviors, allowing retailers to better cater to their customers' needs and preferences while optimizing their strategies for a more effective market presence. This comprehensive approach attempts to uncover deeper insights into the interactions between online and offline purchases, thereby contributing to a more comprehensive understanding of consumer behavior in the retail and e-commerce industries. Design/methodology/approach- A detailed survey questionnaire was administered, obtaining 2465 responses. The questionnaire was specifically designed to capture the complexities of online and offline purchases, with an emphasis on Apple's purchase channels. The Apriori algorithm was used twice to find frequently co-occurring items that were purchased online and then online clubbed with offline. Essential metrics like support and confidence were calculated for both online and offline purchases. To determine any significant differences between the groups, an independent-samples t-test was used. This comprehensive methodology ensures a thorough examination of multi-channel shopping behaviors, providing valuable insights into consumer behavior in the retail and e-commerce sectors. Findings-We find that cross channel switching in a multi-channel distribution environment occurs due to price differences, convenience and flexibility. The paper illustrates the flaws of drawing inferences with data from a single channel emphasizing the need for a more holistic, multi-channel approach to data analysis in order to capture the full range of consumer behavior. Research limitations/implications - This study assumes that self-reported purchases or acquisitions of products accurately reflect actual consumer behavior. The insights derived from this research have significant implications for various marketing strategies, including pricing, product bundling, cross-selling, and promotional activities. However, it's important to note that the reliance on self-reported data may introduce certain limitations, as it may not fully capture the complexity of actual consumer behavior. Despite these limitations, the insights gained from the study will add value for several marketing decisions like pricing, bundling, cross-selling and promotions. Originality value- While there is an abundance of literature on the application of Association Rule Mining for Market Basket Analysis, the existing body of work exploring its application within a multi-channel context is notably sparse.

The symmetry in ship network security needs to maintain a stable state and maintain a constant state of ship network security. With the rapid development of network information technology, smart ships have become a new hot spot in the international shipping industry. The smart ships cybersecurity discussion is also at the top of the list in the maritime field. More and more shipping companies feel that their smart ship systems need to be upgraded and the main reason behind this is that the systems are maliciously attacked by cyber hackers. Therefore, it is extremely important to detect and protect the security of intelligent ship network systems in real time. The issue of network security has always accompanied the whole process of the development of the Internet. At the same time, with the development of Internet technology, network hacking attacks against the Internet have never stopped developing, and traditional ship network security risk detection and protection cannot achieve good results. After understanding the operation mode of intelligent ship networks, this paper deeply studied the characteristics of cloud computing technology and proposed a real-time risk detection method and protection strategy for intelligent ship network security based on cloud computing. This paper mainly used multi-sensor nodes to analyze data containing malicious attack information and implemented self-execution protection strategy generation nodes to intercept and protect from the attack, so as to achieve the purpose of maintaining the network security of intelligent ships. Through experiments, the virus intrusion detection and defense rate of the algorithm proposed in this paper was able to reach 85% to 95%, while the virus intrusion detection defense rate of the traditional intelligent ship network security protection algorithm was 55% to 65%.

The layout of harbors and the permeability of protective structures such as breakwaters influence sediment transport within harbor basins. Thus, through a multistep framework, this study investigates the sedimentation management issues for the Egyptian proposed Ezbet Elborg fishing harbor based on field measurements and a numerical morphodynamic coastal modeling system (CMS). First, field measurements were analyzed and evaluated for acquiring a full grasp of the research area’s bathymetry and hydrodynamics. Second, a two-dimensional (2D) numerical simulation CMS model was set up and calibrated against field measurements wherein the developed CMS model highly correlated with actual measurements by 97%. CMS results demonstrate that the predominant NNW wave with the formed longshore current on both the harbor’s sides affects sediment accumulation within the harbor’s basin. Third, 100 simulations for the proposed harbor including different structural modulation scenarios affecting the sedimentation issue were investigated via the calibrated CMS model. Finally, an exploratory data analysis (EDA) is performed via correlation matrix and ANOVA test for the CMS’s scenarios’ results to gain an in-depth view of the relation between the harbors’ layout and the structural characteristics with the sedimentation volumes. Results showed that breakwaters’ orientation affects sediment accumulation more than its length. Also, breakwater permeability and basin width are significantly affecting sediment accumulation.

Seaports are an important component of the shipping industry architecture. Although there is no common solution, seaports around the globe face the same challenge. Challenges raised include difficulties in integrating new technology into automation, traffic congestion, harmonizing residential communities around the port, quantifying and reducing CO2 emissions as well as planning for the energy transition. In addition, improving the adaptability of the port infrastructure in the context of increased pressure from market demand, labor shortage, and escalating prices should be considered. In that context, a smart port was born as a necessity. However, the understanding of smart ports is very limited. This review examines the recently published smart port literature to clarify the common concepts of smart ports and their development progress on the way to building a sustainable seaport ecosystem. Although smart port metrics and key port performance metrics are organized around four key performance areas including operations, environment, energy, and safety. However, a comprehensive review of all four key areas is very broad and difficult to cover in a review article.

However, it goes without say that the technology also brings with it the risk of abuse leading to trade-based money laundering. This article explores how anti-money-laundering legislation should respond to the use of blockchain technology in shipping and trade. Maritime trade poses unique challenges because of several significant factors: the fact that it concerns large sums but many linked trading transactions over the same goods; its use of documents and involvement of numerous faceless entities; and its cross-border setting. Drawing on tried and tested forms of blockchain technology-based trade transactions, this work examines the fault lines in the current regulatory system and questions how best these gaps should be remedied.

Making accurate forecasts of regional empty container availability could support liner companies and other involved actors by making better relocation decisions, thus avoiding unnecessary transport costs of empty equipment. Previously proposed container availability prediction models are limited to the application in individual regions and typically characterized by a high degree of temporal aggregation. Against this background, this paper introduces two novel approaches based on machine learning and probabilistic techniques to predict the future weekly availability of empty containers for more than 280 locations worldwide. The machine learning and probabilistic prediction models are built by analysing a unique data set of more than 100 million events from past container journeys. These events represent different stages during the transport process of a container. Both models use a two-step forecast logic. First, the expected future location of a container is predicted. Second, the expected timestamp for arriving at that location is estimated. The machine learning model uses artificial neural networks and mixture density networks to forecast the movements of containers. The models are quantitatively assessed and compared to the actual availability of containers and two more conventional forecasting approaches. The results indicate that the probabilistic prediction approach can keep up with conventional approaches while the neural network approach significantly outperforms the other approaches concerning every evaluation metric.","https://www.proquest.com/docview/2890052157?accountid=44943&bdid=84593&_bd=0uQ4nNQ3I3hyhuzFD%2BGwBrmuvfc%3D","https://doi.org/10.1186/s41072-022-00120-x"

Due to the rapid development of maritime activities and the maritime economy, there is a growing demand for computing-intensive and latency-sensitive maritime applications requiring various energy consumption, communication, and computation resources, posing a significant challenge to MIoT devices due to their limited computational ability and battery capacity. Mobile Edge Computing (MEC), which can handle computation tasks at the network’s edge more efficiently and with less latency, is emerging as a paradigm for fulfilling the ever-increasing demands of MIoT applications. However, the exponential increase in the number of MIoT devices has increased the system’s energy consumption, resulting in increased greenhouse gas emissions and a negative impact on the environment. As a result, it is vital for MIoT networks to take traditional energy usage minimization into account. The integration of renewable energy-harvesting capabilities into base stations or MIoT devices possesses the potential to reduce grid energy consumption and carbon emissions. However, making an effective decision regarding task offloading and resource allocation is crucial for maximizing the utilization of the system’s potential resources and minimizing carbon emissions. In this paper, we first propose a green MEC-enabled maritime IoT network architecture to flexibly provide computing-intensive and latency-sensitive applications for MIoT users. Based on the architecture, we formulate the joint task offloading and resource allocation problem by optimizing the total system execution efficiency (including the total size of completed tasks, task execution latency, and the system’s carbon emissions) and then propose a deep-deterministic-policy-gradient-based joint optimization strategy to solve the problem, eventually obtaining an effective resolution through continuous action space learning in the changing environment. Finally, simulation results confirm that our proposal can yield good performance in system execution efficiency compared to other benchmarks; that is, it can significantly reduce the system’s carbon emissions and tasks’ delay and improve the total size of completed tasks.","https://www.proquest.com/docview/2904838206?accountid=44943&bdid=84593&_bd=BM26%2FqoUJpriIJdGsoQXpzOc2A0%3D","https://doi.org/10.3390/electronics12244967"

The dynamic nature of marine environments, where ships traverse vast and unpredictable expanses of oceans and seas, presents big challenges to safety and risk management. Wireless communication technology is widely employed in maritime activities for communication via ocean networks and underwater wireless sensor networks (UWSNs). Maintaining the safety of the maritime environment, effective anomaly detection, prompt risk mitigation, and real-time communication becomes more difficult due to its dynamic nature. International trade and transportation are facilitated by the maritime industry. In addition to protecting lives and averting environmental disasters, maritime safety is important for maintaining the effectiveness and dependability of shipping routes. To handle the intricacies of maritime safety, this work proposes a novel preventive framework for anomaly detection and risk management in Maritime Wireless Communications (MWC). The proposed framework is based on edge computing and machine learning models. The framework makes use of edge computing technology to process data locally, lowering latency and enabling real-time communication in maritime environments. A proactive safety approach has been adopted to ensure the well-being of seafarers, safeguard vessels, and protect the marine environment. As maritime cybersecurity threats continue to evolve, the proposed research aims to enhance the cybersecurity posture of MWC. The framework will incorporate measures to detect and respond to potential cyber threats, ensuring the integrity and security of communication channels under international maritime cybersecurity standards. The proposed anomaly detection framework incorporates machine learning models such as Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and Isolation Forests (IF). The proposed framework also places a strong emphasis on preventative safety measures, including cybersecurity safeguards to protect communication channels in the constantly changing digital marine operations environment. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework, the experiments were performed based on a publicly available dataset and implemented in the context of marine communications. The results show significant accuracy as well as high precision, recall, and F1-score metrics generated by the LSTM and IF models. The results highlight that the proposed framework can detect anomalies and potential threats in real-time marine communications.","https://www.proquest.com/docview/3041516113?accountid=44943&bdid=84593&_bd=YF8JL3wUcGUrjkymZHsn%2B6NK%2FRo%3D","https://doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2024.3387529"

There have been many examples demonstrating the riskiness of the two models above. Specifically, in developing countries (e.g., Vietnam), the demand for exporting goods and trading between sellers and buyers have not yet applied the benefits of current technology to improve traditional shipping models.

These particles can have highly variable physicochemical properties in the atmosphere, and it is crucial to continuously monitor their long-term concentration relative to total ambient aerosol populations at a wide variety of sites to comprehensively understand aerosol–cloud interactions in the atmosphere. Hence, our study applied an in situ forced expansion cooling device to measure ambient INP concentrations and test its automated continuous measurements at atmospheric observatories, where complementary aerosol instruments are heavily equipped. Using collocated aerosol size, number, and composition measurements from these sites, we analyzed the correlation between sources and abundance of INPs in different environments. Toward this aim, we have measured ground-level INP concentrations at two contrasting sites, one in the Southern Great Plains (SGP) region of the United States with a substantial terrestrially influenced aerosol population and one in the Eastern North Atlantic Ocean (ENA) region with a primarily marine-influenced aerosol population. These measurements examined INPs mainly formed through immersion freezing and were performed at a ≤12 min resolution and with a wide range of heterogeneous freezing temperatures (Ts above -31 °C) for at least 45 d at each site. The associated INP data analysis was conducted in a consistent manner. We also explored the additional offline characterization of ambient aerosol particle samples from both locations in comparison to in situ data. From our ENA data, on average, INP abundance ranges from ≈1 to ≈20 L-1(-30 °C ≤T≤-20 °C) during October–November 2020. Backward air mass trajectories reveal a strong marine influence at ENA with 75.7 % of air masses originating over the Atlantic Ocean and 96.6 % of air masses traveling over open water, but analysis of particle chemistry suggests an additional INP source besides maritime aerosols (e.g., sea spray aerosols) at ENA. In contrast, 90.8 % of air masses at the SGP location originated from the North American continent, and 96.1 % of the time, these air masses traveled over land. As a result, organic-rich SGP aerosols from terrestrial sources exhibited notably high INP abundance from ≈1 to ≈100 L-1(-30 °C ≤T≤-15 °C) during October–November 2019. The probability density function of aerosol surface area-scaled immersion freezing efficiency (ice nucleation active surface site density; ns) was assessed for selected freezing temperatures. While the INP concentrations measured at SGP are higher than those of ENA, the ns(T)values of SGP (≈105to ≈107m-2for -30 °C ≤T≤-15 °C) are reciprocally lower than ENA for approximately 2 orders of magnitude (≈107to ≈109m-2for -30 °C ≤T≤-15 °C). The observed difference in ns(T)mainly stems from varied available aerosol surface areas, Saer, from two sites (Saer,SGP>Saer,ENA). INP parameterizations were developed as a function of examined freezing temperatures from SGP and ENA for our study periods.","https://www.proquest.com/docview/3051817116?accountid=44943&bdid=84593&_bd=CX3ukhnmrNEUXGrfJgAXwGz67Q0%3D","https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-24-5433-2024"

These sites are often at risk due to climate change and various human-made impacts such as urban expansion, maritime pollution, and natural deterioration. However, advances in remote sensing (RS) and Earth observation (EO) technologies applied to cultural heritage (CH) sites have led to the development of various techniques for underwater cultural heritage (UCH) exploration. The aim of this work was the evaluation of an integrated methodological approach using ultra-high-resolution (UHR) bathymetric data to aid in the identification and interpretation of submerged archaeological contexts. The study focused on a selected area of the submerged Archaeological Park of Baia (Campi Flegrei, south Italy) as a test site. The study highlighted the potential of an approach based on UHR digital bathymetric model (DBM) derivatives and the use of machine learning and statistical techniques to automatically extract and discriminate features of archaeological interest from other components of the seabed substrate.

Maritime ports are essential interfaces that support cargo handling between sea and hinterland transportation. Besides, in this area, environmental protection is becoming extremely important. Global warming, air pollution, and greenhouse gas emissions are all having a detrimental influence on the environment and will most likely continue to do so for future generations. Hence, there is a growing need to promote environmental sustainability in maritime-based transportation. The application of machine learning (ML), as one of the main subdomains of artificial intelligence (AI), can be considered a component within the process of digital transformation to advance green activities in maritime port logistics. Thus, this article presents the results of a systematic literature review of the recent literature on machine learning for promoting environmentally sustainable maritime ports. It collects and analyses the articles whose contributions lie in the interplay between three main dimensions, i.e., machine learning, port-related operations, and environmental sustainability. Throughout a review protocol, this research is constituted on the major focuses of impact, problems, and techniques to discern the current state of the art as well as research directions. The research findings indicate that the articles using polynomial regression models are dominant in the literature, and the recurrent neural network (RNN) and long short-term memory (LSTM) are the most recent approaches. Moreover, in terms of environmental sustainability, emissions and energy consumption are the most studied problems. mAccording to the research gaps observed in the review, two broad directions for future research are identified: (i) altering attention on a greater diversity of machine learning approaches for promoting environmental sustainability in ports and (ii) leveraging new outlooks to perform more green practical works on port-related operations.","https://www.proquest.com/docview/2785963840?accountid=44943&bdid=84593&_bd=9U5O8zDtaS11QdFS0XZGJjrdoWs%3D","https://doi.org/10.1155/2023/2144733"

Norway and Japan are taking the lead in standard development in this field, and the Korea is also actively participating to reflect the opinions of the domestic industry in the international community. However, related academic research has not been carried out systematically. Therefore, this study attempts to analyze the current status and development of standards in data-related fields among subcommittees of Ships and Marine Technology (SC), which are covered by Technical Committee 8 (TC 8) of the International Organization for Standardization (ISO). Especially, the tasks for the relevant subjects will be performed by appealing to the international society through participation in various international conferences attended by the subcommittee of SC 6 ‘Navigation and Ship Operation’, SC 11 ‘Intermodal and Short Sea Shipping’ or a work group of WG 10 ‘Smart Shipping’ under TC 8, considering the inputs from local experts and Korean Agency for Technology and Standards. In addition, this study examines the current status and problems of data platforms in the shipbuilding and marine sectors, and examines the strategies of Korea and the time and cost benefits that follow them. To this end, this study implements literature review and empirical analysis. This paper collected and analyzed Big Data from January 1, 2020 to December 31, 2020, using the keywords ‘smart ship’, ‘autonomous ship’, ‘marine big data’, ‘data integration platform’, and ‘ship Big Data’. While the domestic shipbuilders were developing their own smart ship data integration platforms, they agreed that they would be vulnerable to global smart ship data integration platform initiatives and standard data development. If the data integration platform is developed or improved through unprecedented collaboration in the competitive systems of the shipbuilding industry, it is would improve the competitiveness of the Korean shipbuilding industry by applying the shipbuilders' Captive volume. Investment costs can also be reduced by leading international standardization and improving platforms for shipyards through joint responses from international standards (ISO).","https://www.proquest.com/docview/2771189496?accountid=44943&bdid=84593&_bd=TqpO0bJeF2hDOqUtQmTxBHsUwX0%3D","https://doi.org/10.1007/s11135-022-01382-0"

This inherent complexity brings huge security challenges, including cargo loss and high burdens in cargo document inspection. The emerging blockchain technology provides a promising tool to build a unified maritime cargo tracking system critical for cargo security. This is because blockchains are a tamper-proof distributed ledger technology that can store and track data in a secure and transparent manner. Using the State of Qatar as a case study, this research introduces the Global Maritime Ledger (GM-Ledger), which will aid authorities in verifying, signing and transacting food certificates in an efficient manner. The methodology of this research includes reviewing past publications, identifying the requirements of various players in the Qatari food import–export industry and then creating a smart contract framework that will efficiently manage the work with necessary human intervention as and when required. The result of this work is the formation of a solid framework that can be employed in future works. This work realized that employing web3 solutions for the food import sector is highly viable and that with the right social, economic and policy reforms, it is possible to transform the entire food system to bear healthy transparency and power balance in global supply chains. In conclusion, this study argues that BCT has the ability to assist the government and other players to minimize fraud and maximize food supply chain stakeholder participation.","https://www.proquest.com/docview/2888107021?accountid=44943&bdid=84593&_bd=TWw6GAJSN%2Fs8OikJ9HDsgabtfXk%3D","https://doi.org/10.3390/foods12213914"

2023","1","5","1-5","10948120","","","ENG","Initially, US-Vietnam relations deteriorated as Vietnam invaded Cambodia in 1978 and aligned itself with the Soviet Uni on.However, after Vietnam withdrew its troops from Cambodia in 1989, the Bush administration decided in 1990 to seek contact with Vietnam to facilitate a peace agreement.^1 In 1991, a multilateral peace accord concluded the Cambodian-Vietnamese War, and the US lifted travel restrictions against Vietnam.ш After increasing diplomatic exchanges in the following years, in July 1995, the two countries normalized relations, agreeing to exchange ambassadors.ш To enable more extensive cooperation, the Foreign Service had to rebuild Americans' trust in their recent enemy by addressing the legacies of war.Because some Americans believed that American soldiers were still being held captive in Vietnam, a full accounting of prisoners of war (POW) and missing in action soldiers (MIA) was necessary to prove that Vietnam was no longer an enemy.Moreover, advocacy groups demanded that the US offer closure to veterans' families and recover soldiers' bodies so that their deaths would not be forgotten.^1 As early as 1992, the Department of Defense established an office of the Joint Task Force-Full Accounting (JTF-FA) in Hanoi.In fact, Vietnamese cooperation in accounting for MIAs was a major reason for the decision to normalize relations.^ Once an embassy was established, under the direction of Charge ď Affaires Desaix Anderson, political officers Ted Osius and Bryan Dalton supported the efforts of JTF-FA.^ Their close coordination with Nguyen Xuân Phong, director of the Americas office at the Foreign Ministry and Vietnam's Office for Seeking Missing Persons, allowed JTF-FA to make steady progress in confirming that no POWs remained in Vietnam and finding the remains of American MIAs.^ To date, over 1,000 American MIAs have been identified and repatriated.^1 To regain the trust of the Vietnamese people, the Foreign Service had to repair the damages the US military had caused.During the Vietnam War, the US sprayed 45.6 million liters of the herbicide Agent Orange, which contained the toxic chemical dioxin, over Vietnamese forests.и'25 More than four million Vietnamese may have been exposed to the substance, which causes serious health effects such as cancer and heart disease.ĽT25 26 From 2013 to 2018, to address the issue of Agent Orange and promote reconciliation, the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) and Vietnam's Ministry of National Defense collaborated to remediate roughly 90,000 square meters of dioxin-contaminated soil at Da Nang Airport, a former US air base.^1 Thanks to the clean-up, commercial activity in Da Nang airport now takes place without fear of health damage due to dioxin exposure.и 27-28 In 2019, the two partners inaugurated a similar project to clean up Bien Hoa Air Base, the largest remaining dioxin hotspot.и'27 Moreover, the US is currently supporting Vietnam's effort to locate and identify fallen Vietnamese soldiers, just as Vietnam has extensively cooperated with MIA efforts for American soldiers.Upstream, China and Laos have constructed more than seventy dams for hydroelectric power generation, threatening to disrupt Vietnam's water supply, harm biodiversity, and reduce agricultural output.^181 This issue is important not only to Vietnam but also to the US because the collapse of the Mekong ecosystem would destabilize regional security, and China's ability to threaten to restrict water flows gives it substantial leverage over Vietnam.и'21 So, in 2008, following a proposal by then-Ambassador Michael Michalak, a DRAGON Institute, conducting environmental research in cooperation with the US Geological Survey, was launched at Can Tho University.^17 In 2009, the US launched the Lower Mekong Initiative, supporting technical and scientific collaboration initiatives such as Forecast Mekong, which utilized data analysis to support water management and address climate variability .Cl15'18 Realizing Common Security Interests In the near future, as the US seeks to pivot to Asia and counter Chinese influence in the region, engagement with Vietnam will be more important than ever.In recent years, China has aggressively asserted its ""nine dash line"" claim, which conflicts with Vietnam's Exclusive Economic Zone.^ The US has an interest in regional stability and maintaining principles of maritime law, including sovereignty and freedom of navigati on.Щ41 While joint military exercises would go against Vietnam's traditional policy of non-alignment, the Foreign Service should provide technical support so that Vietnam can monitor its claim in the South China Sea, collecting and publicizing data about Chinese military vessels/13^71' In terms of economics, the Foreign Service must reinforce trade and investment ties to build soft power.[...]the US should increase its investment presence, emphasizing niche sectors such as education and information technology while providing feasibility studies and project assessments to support infrastructure projects led by other countries.","https://www.proquest.com/docview/2885624100?accountid=44943&bdid=84593&_bd=6OpMXMAxheHe6ZJ%2B1eK1fROzP1A%3D",""

Some of the consequences are ocean warming, melting glaciers, sea levels rising and coastal erosion. One of the means for a sustainable management of coastal areas is to have information on the trend of climatic parameters at the local scale as well as the spatial distribution and dynamics of coastal people. This study is a contribution to the assessment of the extent of climatic parameters and dynamics of coastal peoples in Togo. Climatic data like, precipitation, temperature, wind speed, sunshine, tidal gauge and satellite images (Landsat and Sentinel-2 images) for the period from 1988 to 2020 were used. The Mann-Kendall test and Sen’s slope test were used for climate trend analysis while settlement area mapping was done using Object-Based Image Analysis method. The results revealed a significant trend in temperature and sea level rise. The temperature analysis showed an increase of trend of 0. 038 °C/year while the tidal gauge data analysis showed an increase of trend of 13.75 mm/year. The annual trend of other climatic parameters was not significant but record monthly variability which were significant. The settlement areas has changed from 2. 06% to 11. 85% between 1988 and 2020. Near the sea, the settlement pattern is compacted with high density of people. In the inland this pattern is dispersed. In 1980, the population of the maritime region was estimated at 1,042,385 people while in 2022 it was 3,534,991 people.

The rationale for incorporating cloud technology into a blockchain and integrating the blockchain with machine learning for supply chain applications is to maintain technical sustainability. While previous studies suggested and reported sustainable practices of applying blockchain technology in supply chains, the means with which these practices are brought about by the cloud-based blockchain integrated with machine learning (CBML) have not been thoroughly explored in the literature. The case study presented in this paper aims to fill this gap by exploring technically, environmentally, economically, and socially sustainable practices through the use cases of CBML for supply chain management by the international leading container shipping company Maersk. The use cases by Maersk presented in published documents were collected from the Internet and then analyzed. This document analysis was performed in two ways.

However, due to the increasing number of ships and the increasingly complex maritime traffic environment, the target features in these ship images are often not clear enough, and the key details cannot be clearly identified, which brings difficulty to the segmentation task. To tackle these issues, we present an approach that leverages state-of-the-art technology to improve the precision of ship segmentation in complex environments. Firstly, we employ a multi-scale context features module using different convolutional kernels to extract a richer set of semantic features from the images. Secondly, an enhanced spatial pyramid pooling (SPP) module is integrated into the encoder’s final layer, which significantly expands the receptive field and captures a wider range of contextual information. Furthermore, we introduce an attention module with a multi-scale structure to effectively obtain the interactions between the encoding–decoding processes and enhance the network’s ability to exchange information between layers. Finally, we performed comprehensive experiments on the public SeaShipsSeg and MariBoatsSubclass open-source datasets to validate the efficacy of our approach. Through ablation studies, we demonstrated the effectiveness of each individual component and confirmed its contribution to the overall system performance.

In this study, post-processing methods based on supervised machine learning have been developed for improving the skill of sea ice concentration forecasts from the TOPAZ4 prediction system for lead times from 1 to 10 d. The deep learning models use predictors from TOPAZ4 sea ice forecasts, weather forecasts, and sea ice concentration observations. Predicting the sea ice concentration for the next 10 dtakes about 4 min(including data preparation), which is reasonable in an operational context. On average, the forecasts from the deep learning models have a root mean square error 41 % lower than TOPAZ4 forecasts and 29 % lower than forecasts based on persistence of sea ice concentration observations. They also significantly improve the forecasts for the location of the ice edges, with similar improvements as for the root mean square error. Furthermore, the impact of different types of predictors (observations, sea ice, and weather forecasts) on the predictions has been evaluated.

The novelty of the APS concept influenced the cyber risk paradigm and led to different considerations regarding attack objectives, techniques as well as risk management approaches. The main factor that has led to this is the autoremote operational mode, which refers to autonomous operations and remote supervision and control in case of emergency. The autoremote operational mode influences the risk of cyber attacks due to the increased connectivity and reliance on technology for automating navigational functions. On the other hand, the presence of passengers without crew members imposes a safety risk factor in cyber attacks. In this paper, we propose a new cyber risk management approach for managing the cyber risks against cyber physical systems in general and Autonomous Passenger Ships in particular. Our proposed approach aims to improve the Defense-in-Depth risk management strategy with additional components from the Threat-Informed Defense strategy allowing for more evolved cyber risk management capabilities. Moreover, we have utilized the proposed cyber risk management approach for the proposition of a cybersecurity architecture for managing the cyber risks against an APS use case named milliAmpere2. Additionally, we present our results after conducting a Systematic Literature Review (SLR) in cybersecurity evaluation in the maritime domain. Then, the findings of the SLR were utilized for a suitable evaluation of the proposed risk management approach. Our findings suggest that our proposed risk management approach named Threat-Informed Defense-in-Depth is capable of enriching several risk management activities across different stages in the system development life cycle. Additionally, a comprehensive evaluation of the cybersecurity posture of milliAmpere2 has been conducted using several approaches including risk evaluation, simulation, checklist, and adversary emulation.

Oil spills at sea typically occur due to two reasons: accidental leaks caused by damage to the ship hull or oil tanks (e.g., collisions with coral reefs or sunken objects), and deliberate discharge of used oil from manufacturing equipment, which can lead to environmental contamination and harm to areas designated for oil disposal. The research methodology involves collecting primary data through observations, interviews, and document reviews to understand the impact of oil-contaminated ballast water disposal on marine pollution. Qualitative descriptive methods are employed for data analysis. The findings of this research indicate that the disposal of oil-contaminated ballast water does result in marine pollution.

Effective traffic management in these channels is crucial not only for ensuring navigational safety but also for optimizing port efficiency. A deep understanding of ship behavior within fairways is essential for effective traffic management. This paper applies machine learning techniques, including Decision Tree, Random Forest, and Gradient Boosting Regression, to model and analyze the behavior of various types of ships at specific moments within fairways. The study focuses on predicting four key behavioral parameters: latitude, longitude, speed, and heading. The experimental results reveal that the Random Forest model achieves adjusted R2scores of 0.9999 for both longitude and latitude, 0.9957 for speed, and 0.9727 for heading. All three models perform well in accurately predicting ship positions at different times, with the Random Forest model particularly excelling in speed and heading predictions. It effectively captures the behavior of ships within fairways and provides accurate predictions for different types and sizes of vessels, especially in terms of speed and heading variations as they approach or leave berths. This model offers valuable support for predicting ship behavior, enhancing ship traffic management, optimizing port scheduling, and detecting anomalies.","https://www.proquest.com/docview/3110312451?accountid=44943&bdid=84593&_bd=AIqWK0BncE4p22uSCipdJ04z1S0%3D","https://doi.org/10.3390/app14188484"

However, effective ship-to-ship communication has been recognized as a critical issue and one of the major challenges affecting the success of ship CA. This study intends to investigate the basic trust concerns in the cybersecurity components of the ship CA process and develop a blockchain-based solution for trustworthy communication. The novel idea behind applying blockchain to ship CA decision-making is that the various participating ships in a scenario of dynamically changing ship encounters form a decentralized network of opportunities, which makes blockchain an appealing tool to offer a solution for evaluating and maximizing trust in entity dynamics. The mechanism of entity participation in upholding a master chain for avoiding ship encounters is described in this work. The research begins by analyzing conventional ship CA decision scenarios under COLREGs in order to identify formal communication strategies that can make information more understandable. Based on this, it is demonstrated how beliefs of trust (BoT) between entities are encoded and combined on the chain to enable entities in the encounter scenario to form an initial opinion about another entity before becoming familiar with it. This first encounter occurs during ship CA. Second, this article examines how encounter ships have temporary rights in the process of making CA decisions. This generates blocks and attaches them to the chain at the consensus layer of blockchain technology. Finally, this study undertakes a case test of ship CA based on the aforementioned communication principles. In order to ensure safe and effective communication during brief, one-time ship encounters, the results offer a practical method for conveying CA reasoning in encounter scenarios. As a result, it can aid in the selection of better (more reliable) nodes to uphold the evidence-based understanding of the ship CA process and assess the reliability of unidentified members.","https://www.proquest.com/docview/2882397137?accountid=44943&bdid=84593&_bd=43A5rnehctp61LcRdRRrS%2BA6T18%3D","https://doi.org/10.3390/app132011178"

However, these companies often rely solely on one-way communication for required arrival times provided by terminals. This reliance on fixed schedules can lead to vessels arriving punctually, only to face berths that are still occupied, resulting in unnecessary waiting times. Regrettably, limited attention has been given to these issues from the perspective of shipping companies. This study addresses this gap by focusing on the estimation of dwell times for container vessels at a terminal in the Port of Busan using various machine learning techniques. The estimations were compared against the terminal’s operational reference. To compile the dataset, a 41-month history of terminal berth schedules and vessel particulars data were utilized and preprocessed for effective training.

Six regression machine learning algorithms, namely adaptive learning, gradient boosting, light gradient boosting, extreme gradient boosting, categorical boosting and random forest, were employed, and their parameters were fine-tuned for optimal performance on the validation dataset.

The proposed framework utilizes an Extract, Transform, and Load (ETL) pipeline to dynamically process AIS data by cleaning, compressing, and enhancing it with additional attributes such as online traffic volume, origin/destination, vessel trips, trip direction, and vessel routing. This processed data, enriched with valuable details, serves as an alternative to raw AIS data stored in a centralized database. For user interactions, a user interface is designed to query the database and provide real-time information on a map-based interface. To deal with false or missing AIS records, two methods, dead reckoning and machine learning techniques, are employed to anticipate the trajectory of the vessel in the next time steps. To evaluate each method, several metrics are used, including R squared, mean absolute error, mean offset, and mean offset from the centerline. The functionality of the proposed system is showcased through a case study conducted in the Gulf Intracoastal Waterway (GIWW). Three years of AIS data are collected and processed as a simulated API to transmit AIS records every five minutes. According to our results, the Seq2Seq model exhibits strong performance (0.99 R squared and an average offset of ~1400 ft). However, the second scenario, dead reckoning, proves comparable to the Seq2Seq model as it involves recalculating vessel headings by comparing each data point with the previous one.","https://www.proquest.com/docview/2918777095?accountid=44943&bdid=84593&_bd=6d%2F%2FvWi7TOz8qPNpbYnHhmBAygQ%3D","https://doi.org/10.3390/jmse12010152"

However, the weather-routing services by private sectors are expensive. Further, forecasting results from public institutes are usually free, and they are not in real-time or numerical modes, so they are not quite suitable for small-size or offshore vessels. In this study, an intelligent system was constructed for delivering sea forecasting at specific areas according to the navigator’s order. The system can automatically obtain web-based forecasting charts issued from multi-source meteorological agencies and convert the regional information into numerical text at requested points. During this step, several intelligent algorithms, like the OpenCV digital image processing algorithm and the YOLO wind vector deep learning recognition method, were applied. By applying this state-of-the-art system, navigators on board do not need to download different institutional graphics (usually with large stream bytes) to explore the future states of the sea surface in a specific area in the sailing route but can obtain the multi-source text forecasting information just by sending the area coordinates to a designated email address. The field tests confirmed that this auto-intelligent system could assist the navigator within a few minutes and thus greatly enhance the navigation safety with minor text-based communication costs. It is expected that by improving the efficiency of marine services and bringing in more artificial intelligence technology, maritime security would be more sustainable.","https://www.proquest.com/docview/2924016408?accountid=44943&bdid=84593&_bd=JJXLVjEGsCGxgtZ33XvTM7Eha0o%3D","https://doi.org/10.3390/su16031117"

Traceability is an important tool to ensure that the wood and wood-based products are produced in a legal, sustainable, and ethical manner. Therefore, various technologies were implemented within the supply chain to monitor and trace the wood with the aim of fulfilling the traceability objectives. Using a systematic literature review, this paper provides a comprehensive state-of-the-art on the technologies and procedures used in timber traceability and transportation management. It debates traceability tradition and advanced methods such as smart marking, QR (Quick Response) codes, DNA fingerprinting, smartphone apps, RFID (Radio Freguency Identification), machine learning, and computer vision since these technologies enable the integrity of the supply chain by documenting the source of wood and following up on the wood in all the stages, beginning from the standing tree until the final customer. The paper also reviews the advancements in wood transportation management systems, including spatial databases, GPS (Global Positioning System), and fleet management systems, which ultimately lead to real-time monitoring and optimisation of transportation routes, leading to improved efficiency and minimal environmental impact. The review results acknowledge that financial constraints, infrastructure limitations, data management uncertainties, acceptance and compliance issues, and stakeholder commitment are still challenges to implementing traceability technology in the forestry sector. Moreover, this review not only highlights how traceability systems promote responsible forestry practices, ensure sustainable timber sourcing, and develop supply chain management, but also the advantages of utilising these technological advances at economic, social, and environmental levels.","https://www.proquest.com/docview/3084907476?accountid=44943&bdid=84593&_bd=NwClOwmWGA7r2LN7TSEOemcUXm8%3D","https://doi.org/10.31926/but.fwiafe.2024.17.66.1.2"

Meanwhile, predicting wave height and wave energy is crucial for achieving sustainability as a renewable energy source, as it enables the harnessing of the power of wave energy efficiently based on the water-energy nexus. Advanced wave forecasting models, such as machine learning models and the semi-analytical approach, have been developed to provide more accurate predictions of ocean waves. In this study, the Sverdrup Munk Bretschneider (SMB) semi-analytical approach, Emotional Artificial Neural Network (EANN) approach, and Wavelet Artificial Neural Network (WANN) approach will be used to estimate ocean wave parameters in the Gulf of Mexico and Aleutian Basin. The accuracy and reliability of these approaches will be evaluated, and the spatial and temporal variability of the wave field will be investigated. The available wave characteristics are used to generate hourly, 12-hourly, and daily datasets. The WANN and SMB model shows good performance in the daily prediction of the significant wave height in both case studies. In the SMB model, specifically on a daily time scale, the Nash–Sutcliffe Efficiency (NSE) and the peak deviation coefficient (DCpeak) were determined to be 0.62 and 0.54 for the Aleutian buoy and 0.64 and 0.55 for the Gulf of Mexico buoy, respectively, for significant wave height. In the context of the WANN model and in the testing phase at the daily time scale, the NSE and DCpeak indices exhibit values of 0.85 and 0.61 for the Aleutian buoy and 0.72 and 0.61 for the Gulf of Mexico buoy, respectively, while the EANN model is a strong tool in hourly wave height prediction (Aleutian buoy (NSEEANN = 0.60 and DCpeakEANN = 0.88), Gulf of Mexico buoy (NSEEANN = 0.80 and DCpeakEANN = 0.82)). In addition, the findings pertaining to the energy spectrum density demonstrate that the EANN model exhibits superior performance in comparison to the WANN and SMB models, particularly with regard to accurately estimating the peak of the spectrum (Aleutian buoy (DCpeakEANN= 0.41), Gulf of Mexico buoy (DCpeakEANN = 0.59)).","https://www.proquest.com/docview/2869660332?accountid=44943&bdid=84593&_bd=zDk6bYg2v%2FK12%2FAGC0T6oDpghJQ%3D","https://doi.org/10.3390/w15183254"

However, their limited energy resources remains a critical issue in providing long-term data transmission support for maritime applications. In this study, an integrated sea–air–terrestrial communication system was constructed for marine data collection, where several unmanned surface vessels (USVs) are deployed to collect marine data from underwater sensors (UWSs), and a UAV hovers above these USVs as a relay node, transmitting marine data from USVs to an onshore base station (BS). To prolong the lifetime of the UAV relay, mobile edge computing technology is applied in USVs for partial data computing, which reduces the to-be-relayed data volume from UAVs to USVs to onshore BS as well as the relay energy consumption of UAV. A parallel data computing and transmission scheme was developed for simultaneous local data computing and relaying in the proposed system. Accordingly, a UAV energy consumption minimization problem was formulated with constraints on the USV’s computational ability, the USV’s transmission power budget, the UAV transmission power budget, and the maximum system latency. To effectively solve this nonconvex optimal problem, an energy optimal partial data computing and relaying strategy was constructed by successively optimizing the data partial computational offloading ratio, USV transmit power allocation, and UAV transmit power.

When a vessel is navigating autonomously, it must determine the optimal route by itself and accurately follow the designated route using route-following control technology. First, the optimal route should be generated in a manner that ensures safety and reduces fuel consumption by the vessel. To satisfy safety requirements, sea depth, under-keel clearance, and navigation charts are used; algorithms capable of determining and shortening the distance of travel and removing unnecessary waypoints are used to satisfy the requirements for reducing fuel consumption. In this study, a reinforcement-learning algorithm-based machine learning technique was used to generate an optimal route while satisfying these two sets of requirements. Second, when an optimal route is generated, the vessel must have a route-following controller that can accurately follow the set route without deviation. To accurately follow the route, a velocity-type fuzzy proportional–integral–derivative (PID) controller was established. This controller can prevent deviation from the route because overshoot rarely occurs, compared with a proportional derivative (PD) controller. Additionally, because the change in rudder angle is smooth, energy loss by the vessel can be reduced. Here, a method for determining the presence of environmental disturbance using the characteristics of the Kalman filter innovation process and estimating environmental disturbance with a fuzzy disturbance estimator is presented, which allows the route to be accurately maintained even under conditions involving environmental disturbance. The proposed approach can automatically set the vessel’s optimal route and accurately follow the route without human intervention, which is useful and can contribute to maritime safety and efficiency improvement.","https://www.proquest.com/docview/2819459042?accountid=44943&bdid=84593&_bd=2K8Z5UzEeuanBQdW9DEdDSEK2YQ%3D","https://doi.org/10.3390/jmse11050970"

We used the poison frog algorithm to generate poisoning instances, and trained a YOLOv5 model with both clean and poisoned data. Despite the high accuracy of the model, it misclassified boats as ferries owing to the poisoning of the target instance. Although the experiment was conducted under limited conditions, we confirmed vulnerabilities in the object detection algorithm.

To meet this growing demand, terminal operators worldwide are turning to automated container handling. For the automated operation of a crane, a reliable capture of the environment is required. In current state-of-the-art applications this is mostly achieved with light detection and ranging (LiDAR) sensors. These sensors enable precise three-dimensional sampling of the surroundings, even at great distances. However, the use of LiDAR sensors has a number of disadvantages, such as high acquisition costs and limited mounting positions. This raises the question of whether the LiDAR systems of automated container terminals (ACT) can be replaced with cameras. However, this transformation is not easy to accomplish and is explored in more depth in this paper. The field of camera-based container automation presented in this publication is largely unexplored. To the best of our knowledge, there is currently no automated container terminal in real-world operation that exclusively uses cameras. This publication aims to create a basis for further scientific research towards the goal of a fully camera-based container automation.

"A Machine-Learning-Based Method for Ship Propulsion Power Prediction in Ice","","Zhou, Li; Sun, Qianyang; Ding, Shifeng; Ding, Shifeng; Sen, Han; Wang, Aimin","Journal of Marine Science and Engineering","Scholarly Journals","","11","7","2023-01-01","2023","1381","","","20771312","","","ENG","In recent years, safety issues respecting polar ship navigation in the presence of ice have become a research hotspot. The accurate prediction of propulsion power plays an important role in ensuring safe ship navigation and evaluating ship navigation ability, and deep learning has been widely applied in the field of shipping, of which the artificial neural network (ANN) is a common method. This study combines the scientific problems of ice resistance and propulsion power for polar ship design, focusing on the design of an ANN model for predicting the propulsion power of polar ships. Reference is made to the traditional propulsion power requirements of various classification societies, as well as ship model test and full-scale test data, to select appropriate input features and a training dataset. Three prediction methods are considered: building a radial basis function–particle swarm optimization algorithm (RBF-PSO) model to directly predict the propulsion power; based on the full-scale test and model test data, calculating the propulsion power using the Finnish–Swedish Ice Class Rules (FSICR) formula; using an ice resistance artificial neural network model (ANN-IR) to predict the ice resistance and calculate the propulsion power using the FSICR formula. Prediction errors are determined, and a sensitivity analysis is carried out with respect to the relevant parameters of propulsion power based on the above methods. This study shows that the RBF-PSO model based on nine feature inputs has a reasonable generalization effect. Compared with the data of the ship model test and full-scale test, the average error is about 14%, which shows that the method has high accuracy and can be used as a propulsion power prediction tool.","https://www.proquest.com/docview/2843081920?accountid=44943&bdid=84593&_bd=iddgvzMBCV5R8gWoV94UdLISNuY%3D","https://doi.org/10.3390/jmse11071381"

For a quite long time, big cities all around the world have been particularly concerned about rising waste. For countries with inadequate waste management procedures and faster-rising garbage volumes, this is a severe problem. Many of the waste management systems in use in cities today do not come with features like operational transparency, traceability, audit, security, and trusted data provenance. The way solid waste is managed has evolved as a result of the Internet of Things, Global Positioning System, and cloud computing methods. The research community has also developed numerous waste management methods based on the Internet of Things and blockchain, and machine learning. Using the method of a systematic literature review, this research examines several waste management approaches. Based on the considered 178 research papers, this paper provides the opportunities brought about by the Internet of Things, machine learning, Global Positioning System, and Blockchain in various waste management techniques, their application scenarios, real-time tracing and tracking of waste, reliable channelization and compliance with waste treatment, efficient waste resource management, protection of waste management documentation, and fleet management. Based on the conducted review, this paper presents open challenges associated with waste management techniques that act as future research directions. Waste bin placement and its security, internet connectivity with waste management components, transportation of waste, and waste disposal techniques are the main categories of challenges associated with waste management.

Sensor devices can provide real-time or near real-time condition monitoring and location tracking of assets during the shipping process, helping to detect delays, prevent loss, and stop fraud. However, the integration of low-cost WSN/IoT systems into a pre-existing industry should first consider security within the context of the application environment. In the case of logistics, the sensors are mobile, unreachable during the deployment, and accessible in potentially uncontrolled environments. The risks to the sensors include physical damage, either malicious/intentional or unintentional due to accident or the environment, or physical attack on a sensor, or remote communication attack. The easiest attack against any sensor is against its communication. The use of IoT sensors for logistics involves the deployment conditions of mobility, inaccesibility, and uncontrolled environments. Any threat analysis needs to take these factors into consideration. This paper presents a threat model focused on an IoT-enabled asset tracking/monitoring system for smart logistics. A review of the current literature shows that no current IoT threat model highlights logistics-specific IoT security threats for the shipping of critical assets. A general tracking/monitoring system architecture is presented that describes the roles of the components. A logistics-specific threat model that considers the operational challenges of sensors used in logistics, both malicious and non-malicious threats, is then given.

Thus, enterprise data management becomes critical when implementing IoT projects. However, the implementation of data management needs to be governed. Although the IoT adoption in smart ports receives significant interest from the port authority, the effectiveness of the IoT adoption lacks proper evaluation and support of comprehensive data management policy and guidelines. By using the systematic literature review and a case study to analyze the current gaps in IoT data governance research, this research shows that IoT data governance still needs to catch up in smart ports. In particular, compared to other industries, data lifecycle management and data quality management are two key data governance areas that should receive increasing attention from the port authorities.

Total Suspended Matter (TSM) is an important parameter to measure urban water quality. Therefore, it is essential to carry out real-time and efficient monitoring of the total suspended matter of urban water bodies to ensure water quality safety of urban water bodies. In this paper, the inversion model of TSM concentration of urban water is constructed using Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) multi-spectral images and measured TSM concentration data. The results show that: (1) The NIR band of the UAV image is highly sensitive to TSM concentration. (2) When the sample size is small, it is found that the TSM regression model is more stable and explanatory than the machine learning model. (3) The overall water quality of urban water bodies is poor, especially in areas with intense human activities such as shipping and construction. The TSM concentration in the river reaches is high, and the TSM concentration in the wider river reaches is higher than that in the narrow river channels and Landscape Lakes, and the TSM concentration remains stable in a certain length of river reaches.

In this light, telematics-enabled FTAs support freight transport operations utilized by individual stakeholders in three overarching service dimensions: transport management, fleet management, and risk management.

For this reason, we establish a design science research project, conceptualize a shared Freight Service Intelligence Platform (FSIP), and introduce freight service intelligence as an interdisciplinary research field. To this aim, we first review related literature, interview 14 transport stakeholders, and theorize six meta-requirements. Second, we propose five design principles that indicate how the meta-requirements may be associated. Third, we develop a web-based prototype application to instantiate the proposed design principles comprising performance analytics, anomaly detection, risk assessment including prediction, data exchange, communication, and IS integration.

By maintaining specific transportation temperatures and adjusting to environmental factors, these systems delay decomposition. Wireless sensor networks (WSN) can be used to monitor the temperature levels at different locations within these transportation containers and provide feedback to these systems. However, there are a range of unique challenges in WSN implementations, such as the cost of the hardware, implementation difficulties, and the general ruggedness of the environment. This paper presents the novel results of a real-life application, where a sensor network was implemented to monitor the environmental temperatures at different locations inside commercial temperature-controlled shipping containers. The possibility of predicting one or more locations inside the container in the absence or breakdown of a logger placed in that location is explored using combinatorial input–output settings. A total of 1016 machine learning (ML) models are exhaustively trained, tested, and validated in search of the best model and the best combinations to produce a higher prediction result. The statistical correlations between different loggers and logger combinations are studied to identify a systematic approach to finding the optimal setting and placement of loggers under a cost constraint. Our findings suggest that even under different and incrementally higher cost constraints, one can use empirical approaches such as neural networks to predict temperature variations in a location with an absent or failed logger, within a margin of error comparable to the manufacturer-specified sensor accuracy. In fact, the median test accuracy is 1.02 degrees Fahrenheit when using only a single sensor to predict the remaining locations under the assumptions of critical system failure, and drops to as little as 0.8 and 0.65 degrees Fahrenheit when using one or three more sensors in the prediction algorithm. We also demonstrate that, by using correlation coefficients and time series similarity measurements, one can identify the optimal input–output pairs for the prediction algorithm reliably under most instances. For example, discrete time warping can be used to select the best location to place the sensors with a 92% match between the lowest prediction error and the highest similarity sensor with the rest of the group. The findings of this research can be used for power management in sensor batteries, especially for long transportation routes, by alternating standby modes where the temperature data for the OFF sensors are predicted by the ON sensors.","https://www.proquest.com/docview/2812741204?accountid=44943&bdid=84593&_bd=3Q8RNQEgzPbpODtBHiHWh2SPcKI%3D","https://doi.org/10.3390/s23094303"

Accurately predicting the CII of ships could help ship operators dynamically evaluate the possible CII grate of a ship at the end of the year and choose appropriate methods to improve its CII grade to meet the IMO requirement with minimum cost. This study developed and compared five CII predicting models with multiple data sources. It integrates diverse data sources, including Automatic Identification System (AIS) data, sensor data, meteorological data, and sea state data from 2022, and extracts 21 relevant features for the vessel CII prediction. Five machine learning methods, including Artificial Neural Network (ANN), Support Vector Regression (SVR), Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO), Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost), and Random Forest (RF), are employed to construct the CII prediction model, which is then applied to a 2400 TEU container ship. Features such as the mean period of total swell, mean period of wind waves, and seawater temperature were considered for inclusion as inputs in the model. The results reveal significant correlations between cumulative carbon emissions intensity and features like cumulative distance, seawater temperature, wave period, and swell period. Among these, the strongest correlations are observed with cumulative distance and seawater temperature, having correlation coefficients of 0.45 and 0.34, respectively. Notably, the ANN model demonstrates the highest accuracy in CII prediction, with an average absolute error of 0.0336, whereas the LASSO model exhibits the highest error of 0.2817.

These challenges necessitate innovative approaches to optimize propeller-hull performance. This study aims to assess a method for predicting propeller-hull degradation. The proposed solution revolves around an innovative Key Performance Indicator (KPI) based on Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs). Our objective is to validate the findings; thus, a thorough comparison is conducted between the proposed method and the baseline solution derived from the ISO-19030. Emphasis is placed on determining the optimal parameters for computing the KPI, which involves applying various features, filters, and pre-processing techniques. The proposed method is tested on real data collected by an Internet of Things (IoT) system installed in different types of vessels. Four distinct experiments with ANNs are conducted. Results demonstrate that the ANN-based indicator offers greater accuracy in predicting propeller-hull degradation compared to the baseline method. Additionally, it is demonstrated that selecting a diverse set of features and implementing consistent filtering and preprocessing techniques enhance the performance of the traditional indicator. The utilization of Deep Learning (DL) in the maritime industry is of great significance, as it enables a comprehensive and dynamic assessment of predictive maintenance of the propeller-hull.

The governments incentivize radical reductions in harmful emissions as an overall priority. If the politics do not change, the continuous implementation of stricter government regulations for reducing emissions will eventually result in the mandatory use of, what we currently consider, alternative fuels. Immediate application of radically different strategies would significantly increase the economic costs of maritime transport, thus jeopardizing its greatest benefit: the transport of massive quantities of freight at the lowest cost. Increased maritime transport costs would immediately disrupt the global economy, as seen recently during the COVID-19 pandemic.

To solve this problem, machine learning and deep learning techniques that have recently been in the spotlight are being applied, but these techniques require a large amount of data. In order to supplement insufficient active sonar data, methods based on mathematical modeling are primarily utilized. However, mathematical modeling-based methods have limitations in accurately simulating complicated underwater phenomena.

In doing so, this study examines the impact of a firm’s relationship commitment and customer integration on supply chain performance. The aim is to detail a way to increase supply chain performance through the relationship between companies and their customers.Design/methodology/approachThe empirical analysis was based on a survey on 205 corporate-Egypt multi-industry businesses including manufacturing, retailing, wholesaling and shipping services firms. Data collection was through a questionnaire survey distributed to 1,264 senior managers with responsibilities in the field of supply chain, logistics, purchasing, marketing and operations and with a 16% response rate. A conceptual model was designed, and hypotheses were analysed with covariance-based structural equation modelling.FindingsThis study makes a significant contribution to the supply chain management (SCM) literature by examining the influence of firms’ relationship commitment on supply chain performance in the supply chain management context by means of the disaggregation of customer integration into two dimensions: integration with customer (IWC) and integration by customer (IBC). The findings indicate that firms’ relationship commitment does not relate directly to supply chain performance, but rather indirectly through integration both with and by customers.Research limitations/implicationsThis paper outlines a conceptual model in which firms’ relationship commitment relates indirectly to supply chain performance. The model also sheds light on the fact that IWCs precedes IBCs in supply chains. This finding suggests that firms should focus on customer integration to improve supply chain performance.Practical implicationsThis study offers a particularly refined understanding of the reasons behind and situations in which supply chain integration (SCI) enables firms to gain superior supply chain performance. In fact, firms focusing on customer integration may improve their supply chain performance, thus enhancing the value of the supply chain.Originality/valueThis study contributes to the literature by considering a relational view of the SCI-Performance path.

To assure the quality of the models and their robustness to different inputs, synthetic data may be generated using other ML-based methods, such as Triplet Encoded Variable Autoencoder (TVAE), copulas, or a Conditional Tabular Generative Adversarial Network (CTGAN). With this approach, a dataset can be trained using ML methods such as Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) or Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGB) to improve the general performance. The methods are applied to the dataset containing mass flow, temperature, and pressure measurements in seven points of a marine steam turbine as inputs, along with the exergy efficiency (η) and destruction (Ex) of the whole turbine (WT), low-pressure cylinder (LPC) and high-pressure cylinder (HPC) as outputs. The achieved results show that models trained on synthetic data achieve slightly worse results than the models trained on original data in previous research, but allow for the use of as little as two-thirds of the dataset to achieve these results.

This study proposes a Support Vector Regression-based parameterization modelling (SVR-PM) for the WDF. Using extensive buoy data and ocean hydrodynamic reanalysis data, we trained an SVR model to compute the WDF in real-time based on real-time wind speed. The SVR-PM was integrated into an oil spill model to enhance the computation of the wind-induced velocity term. We validated the model using satellite images of two significant oil spills, resulting in an excellent average agreement. The SVR-PM's advantage lies in enhancing the accuracy of wind-induced velocity term in oil spill simulations and demonstrating strong adaptability and generalizability over time and space.

However, the stern ramp recovery of the USV is still in its infancy due to its unique attitude requirements and automation design. Furthermore, few studies have addressed the impact of maritime disturbances, with most research limited to simulations. To enhance the efficiency and accuracy of stern ramp recovery, this paper presents the development and construction of a novel recovery system. By incorporating physical modeling of disturbance forces acting on USVs at sea, the practicality of the system is improved. Additionally, an optimized genetic algorithm is introduced in the navigation module to improve convergence rates and subsequently enhance recovery efficiency. A line-of-sight (LOS) algorithm based on average velocity is proposed in this paper to ensure the attainment of unique attitude requirements and to improve the effectiveness of stern chute recovery.

Its essence lies in the application of digital modeling techniques, which leverage extensive ship data to facilitate efficient operations. In this regard, effective modeling and accurate prediction of the fluctuation patterns of ship traffic in multiple port regions will provide data support for trade analysis, port construction planning, and traffic safety management. In order to better express the potential interdependencies between ports, inspired by graph neural networks, this paper proposes a data-driven approach to construct a multi-port network and designs a spatiotemporal graph neural network model. The model incorporates graph attention networks and a dilated causal convolutional architecture to capture the temporal and spatial dimensions of traffic variation patterns. It also employs a gated-mechanism-based spatiotemporal bi-dimensional feature fusion strategy to handle the potential unequal relationships between the two dimensions of features. Compared to existing methods for port traffic prediction, this model fully considers the network characteristics of the overall port and fills the research gap in multi-port scenarios.

Existing sensors such as visible light cameras and LIDAR will fail in bad weather, so this paper proposes a design scheme for maritime emergency rescue based on thermal infrared cameras. Infrared thermal imaging is a technology that converts infrared thermal radiation into electrical signals and displays them through the screen, which is unaffected in low visibility environments such as bad weather and night and still works normally, and is a great aid to maritime emergency rescue. The accurate identification of maritime vessels is achieved by selecting the YOLOV5 target detection algorithm with high accuracy, the accurate ranging of maritime vessels by monocular ranging algorithm, and finally the whole project is deployed to NVIDIA Jetson AGX Xavier high-performance edge computing device for inference acceleration using TensorRT framework. To verify the effect of different sizes of network structures on the training of the dataset, experiments were conducted on YOLOV5’s s-model, m-model, l-model and x-model, respectively, and the results showed that the detection results of these four models were comparable, however, the inference frame rates did vary greatly. In windows the inference frame rate is 19fps for the s-model, 15fps for the m-model, 9fps for the l-model and 4fps for the x-model. The s-model was chosen to be used in the subsequent study. The s-model was accelerated by TensorRT to increase the frame rate from 19fps to 30fps, enabling real-time detection and ranging functions.

These systems are typically heterogeneous, including Internet of Things and information technology subsystems, and can present a myriad of implementation details, making them very complex systems. An important type of CPS is a maritime container terminal (cargo port), which is a facility where cargo containers are transported between ships and land vehicles for onward transportation and vice versa. A cargo port performs four basic functions: receiving, storing, staging, and loading for both import and export containers. We present here process patterns that describe the functional aspects of cargo ports and a pattern that describes their structural properties (patterns are encapsulated solutions to recurrent problems). These patterns describe semantic aspects found in any cargo port and can be adapted to describe other CPSs. We decompose these process patterns into use cases that describe their interactions with the system. We then integrate the process patterns with structural patterns to assemble a partial reference architecture (RA) that shows the interactions of all the patterns while also indicating the typical stakeholders found in all ports. We validate the proposed reference architecture, highlighting its theoretical and practical value. Software and system designers of cargo ports need to start from a conceptual and abstract view that is subsequently refined to add more details. The use of reference architectures and patterns is an effective way to organize and describe the functional and non-functional aspects of a system, as well as to unify the design of all its aspects. This is, until now, the only published RA for cargo ports, and it can be a useful guideline for the designers of any type of cargo port.","https://www.proquest.com/docview/2806519632?accountid=44943&bdid=84593&_bd=oROYhSQjeGKVgqQRD%2FipxFQq1p0%3D","https://doi.org/10.3390/fi15040139"

Offices and factories closed, production of goods and services declined and supply chains got severely disrupted. Many companies were embattled with the grim reality of shrinkage of aggregate demand, first due to supply shock and later due to loss of jobs and wages. Amidst all this, the handling and shipping of commodities became extremely complex. As the pandemic shifted consumer preference in favour of digital platforms, more and more fast-moving consumer goods (FMCG) companies were confronted with multiple strategies and choices of an appropriate distribution channel to ensure smooth delivery of raw materials and products. The present study aims to study this shift and its implications in the Indian context.Design/methodology/approachA mix-method approach, integrating quantitative and qualitative analysis, is employed to investigate the factors influencing the selection of distribution channels amongst general trade, modern trade, e-commerce and hyperlocal for FMCG companies in India. The first phase of the study uses exploratory factor analysis (EFA), followed by the application of analytical hierarchy process (AHP) approach in a fuzzy environment to realise the priority weights and ranking of the identified factors. Finally, sensitivity analysis is performed to confirm the robustness of the fuzzy analytical hierarchy process (FAHP) outcomes.FindingsThe study revealed that modern trade has emerged as the most favoured channel in the post-pandemic Indian economy. It has the potential to disrupt general trade. The study also revealed that the hyperlocal delivery model is not economically viable, and the partnership of FMCG companies with these applications is at best a short-term solution. However, it must be submitted that due to its sheer capability to ensure quick deliveries within a confined geographic area, hyperlocal delivery will gain momentum with the advancement of technology.Originality/valueThis study can be seen as the first attempt to investigate the issues related to the selection of the distribution channels in the FMCG sector of India using multi-criteria decision-making technique (MCDM).","https://www.proquest.com/docview/2815140523?accountid=44943&bdid=84593&_bd=RqyuX9tFl9G2VqoEz4j9UD2N6Bs%3D","https://doi.org/10.1108/MD-03-2022-0407"

Several outbreaks of SARS-CoV-2 have been reported on warships at sea, where transmission is facilitated by living and working in close quarters. Core components of infection control measures such as social distancing, patient isolation and quarantine of exposed persons are extremely difficult to implement. Whole genome sequencing (WGS) of SARS-CoV-2 has facilitated epidemiological investigations of outbreaks, impacting on outbreak management in real time by identifying transmission patterns, clusters of infection and guiding control measures. We suggest such a capability could mitigate against the impact of SARS-CoV-2 in maritime settings.MethodsWe set out to establish SARS-CoV-2 WGS using miniaturised nanopore sequencing technology aboard the Royal Fleet Auxiliary ARGUS while at sea. Objectives included designing a simplified protocol requiring minimal reagents and processing steps, the use of miniaturised equipment compatible for use in limited space, and a streamlined and standalone data analysis capability to allow rapid in situ data acquisition and interpretation.ResultsEleven clinical samples with blinded SARS-CoV-2 status were tested at sea. Following viral RNA extraction and ARTIC sequencing library preparation, reverse transcription and ARTIC PCR-tiling were performed. Samples were subsequently barcoded and sequenced using the Oxford Nanopore MinION Mk1B.

The types of marine oil spill pollution generally include different types of oil products as well as crude oil and its emulsions in different states. This paper designed and implemented two outdoor oil spill simulation experiments, obtained the hyperspectral and thermal infrared remote sensing data of different oil spill pollution types, constructed a hyperspectral recognition algorithm of oil spill pollution type based on classical machine learning, ensemble learning and deep learning models, and explored to improve the identification ability of hyperspectral oil spill pollution type by adding thermal infrared features. The research shows that hyperspectral combined with thermal infrared remote sensing can effectively improve the recognition accuracy of different oils, but thermal infrared remote sensing cannot be used to distinguish crude oil and high concentration water-in-oil emulsion. On this basis, the recognition ability of hyperspectral combined with thermal infrared for different oil film thicknesses is also discussed.

The rapid progression of modern scientific and technological innovations offers a shift from traditional shipping paradigms. Current systems, whether domestic like Cash-on-Delivery (CoD) or international such as Letter-of-Credit, necessitate trust-building through an intermediary—be it a carrier or a financial institution. While these conventional systems provide certain benefits, they inherently present several challenges and potential vulnerabilities, affecting both sellers and buyers. The introduction of blockchain technology and smart contracts has been explored as a viable alternative to bypass these intermediaries. However, simply removing the shipping intermediary presents its own set of issues, particularly when disputes arise. Notably, the shipper remains unaffected in situations of contention. Consequently, some models are now incorporating the shipper’s role, either as a singular entity or in collaboration with others. Yet, a considerable number of these models still depend on an external trusted party for conflict resolution. Our study introduces a unique framework, blending the robustness of blockchain, the enforceability of smart contracts, and the authenticity assurance of NFTs. This system creates a streamlined CoD operation encompassing the seller, shipper, and buyer, using NFTs to produce digital receipts, guaranteeing both proof-of-purchase and a security deposit. Furthermore, our system provides an inherent mechanism for dispute resolution. Key contributions of our work including i) The design of a novel CoD system anchored on blockchain and smart contract capabilities; ii) The incorporation of Ethereum-based NFT (specifically, ERC721) for securely logging package information; iii) The development of smart contracts that facilitate NFT generation and transfer between transactional entities; and iv) Performance evaluation and deployment of these contracts across multiple EVM-compatible platforms such as BNB Smartchain, Fantom, Celo, and Polygon, establishing the optimal environment for our innovative system.","https://www.proquest.com/docview/2893797273?accountid=44943&bdid=84593&_bd=Gg226zNUkntAjjyry8VBlAGBEvE%3D","https://doi.org/10.14569/IJACSA.2023.01410102"

However, increasing reliance on digital technologies has made the industry vulnerable to cybersecurity threats that may compromise the safety and security of maritime operations, thereby potentially affecting global supply chain integrity and public safety. This study examines the vulnerability of the ISO 19847:2018 standard shipboard data server to distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks and proposes a method to mitigate this vulnerability. To this end, we propose modifications to the MQTT v5 protocol used by the shipboard data server, which provides streaming data-transfer services, and conduct verification experiments. These modifications allow the shipboard data server to control the frequency of messages published by the MQTT publisher, thereby preventing it from being overwhelmed by massive amounts of traffic in the event of a DDoS attack. Therefore, the proposed method can enhance the overall cybersecurity of the maritime sector by preventing the misuse of onboard MQTT publishers and reducing the impact of DDoS attacks.","https://www.proquest.com/docview/2819460461?accountid=44943&bdid=84593&_bd=Le%2FjOPPNjwxWlXkHZpgJL4HA%2Fxk%3D","https://doi.org/10.3390/jmse11051000"

Consequently, it is necessary to develop an efficient management system that offers traceability and condition monitoring capabilities to ensure the safe and high-quality delivery of goods. Moreover, it is crucial to guarantee the accuracy and dependability of distribution data. In this context, this paper proposes a blockchain-enabled IoT logistics system for the efficient tracking and management of high-price shipments. A smart contract based on blockchain technology has been designed for automatic approval and payment, with the aim of distributing shipping information exclusively among legitimate logistics parties. To ensure authentication, a zero-knowledge proof is used to conceal the blockchain address. Moreover, an intelligent parcel (iParcel) containing piezoresistive sensors is developed to pack delivered goods during the shipping process for violation detection such as severe falls or theft. The iParcels are automatically tracked and traced, and if a violation occurs, the contract is cancelled, and payment is refunded.

The species distribution maps produced by each of the methodological approaches under study were reclassified into presence–absence binary maps of species to perform the agreement analysis. The results showed that the MaxEnt-predicted map for the present matched well the species’ current distribution, but the species ecological envelope map, also for the present, was closer to the species’ empiric potential distribution. Climate change impacts on the species’ future distributions maps using the MaxEnt were moderate, but areas were relocated.

Maritime shipping firms, the backbone of global supply chains, are particularly affected by this volatility. In response, these firms have pursued two strategies. First, they have acquired tangible assets to increase their capacity. These assets, however, are neither easily re‐deployable to other uses nor quickly adjustable, preventing firms from flexibly matching supply and demand. Second, these firms have pursued global supply chain integration by acquiring similar firms or firms in their upstream or downstream supply chain to diversify into other supply chain activities. Anecdotal evidence suggests that some firms have successfully pursued these strategies, but others have failed, eventually exiting the market. We posit that one explanation for this difference may be how effectively these firms manage their assets relative to their supply chain integration activities. We test this proposition by drawing from resource‐based theory and transaction cost economics and using longitudinal data for 148 maritime shipping firms. We also test post hoc whether typically acquired supply chain activities are beneficial.

This article explores new service behaviors driven by market orientation and customer predictive abilities, revealing the process of customer-driven value creation for sustainable innovation within enterprises. Ships are typical representatives of customized enterprises. This study examines the role of customer predictive capabilities in the sustainable innovation of shipbuilding companies, starting from a 20-year historical analysis of the global shipping and shipbuilding markets. By exploring the market orientation characteristics of the shipbuilding and shipping markets, this study investigates the behavioral impact of customer predictive abilities on sustainable innovation within shipbuilding enterprises. Employing time series and panel data in machine learning algorithms, specifically the random forest model, reveals a strong and statistically significant correlation between new ship deliveries and the Baltic dry index (BDI), with larger value ships having a more pronounced impact on the consumer market. The correlation analysis confirms that these two variables, in combination, can comprehensively reflect customer predictive ability and serve as crucial decision criteria for customer investment in new ship production. Furthermore, based on the principal component analysis of customer predictive ability and ship innovation levels Granger causality tests, this study demonstrates that customer predictive ability is a Granger cause of sustainable innovation in customized production.

This paper aims to assess the continuous monitoring and tracking of container shipments at the ports in order to reduce carbon emissions thus improving environmental performance. In this research, near real-time RFID data tracing and tracking container cargo are shared by the automated monitoring system. The collected data gathered via digitalization is further analyzed to ensure a greener maritime logistics system. The significant findings of the study for the literature show that the actual fuel consumption is reduced when automated monitoring systems are used at the ports (Ports and CFS (Container freight station)). The reduced fuel consumption during the transit between the ports and CFS has resulted in a reduction in carbon emissions of environmental performance. The results show a 6 % reduction in emissions from port to CFS and 23% from CFS to ports. Thus, effective practices in Green Logistics are considered to be beneficial for carbon emissions. These findings contribute to the understanding and development of effective strategies for logistic operations using technologies to create a green performance.

There are thousands of transportation companies on the market whose sole purpose is to deliver ordered goods from pickup to delivery. Transportation can be carried out by two types of fleets. A company can have its own trucks, or it can use third-party companies. This transportation can be carried out in a variety of formulas, with full truckload being the most common for long routes. The shipper must be aware of the potential cost of such a service during the process of selecting a particular transport. The presented solution addresses this exact issue. There are many approaches, ranging from detailed cost calculators to machine learning solutions. The present study uses a dedicated hybrid algorithm that combines different techniques, spanning clustering algorithms, regression and kNN (k Nearest Neighbors) estimators. The resulting solution was tested on real shipping data covering multi-year contract data from several shipping companies operating in the European market. The obtained results proved so successful that they were implemented in a commercial solution used by freight forwarding companies on a daily basis.","https://www.proquest.com/docview/2856753282?accountid=44943&bdid=84593&_bd=DjUMJv7DU0jhjCVvneL9jrZlYgE%3D","https://doi.org/10.3390/a16080360"

This study uses partial least squares to analyze data through SmartPLS 3.0 software. The data analysis procedure consists of assessing the reliability and validity of the measurement model and the evaluation of the structural model. The research results show that delivery quality and perceived price affect the perceived value and do not affect satisfaction. In contrast, perceived value directly affects repeat purchase intention and indirectly through satisfaction. Online stores should pay attention to order processing time, packaging time and cooperate with shipping companies to improve delivery quality.

In the considered multi-UAV maritime IoT system, the UAVs act as the aerial base stations to complete the missions of data collection from buoys and data offloading to the offshore base station (OBS). In this case, the UAVs need to adaptively select the mission mode between data collection and data offloading according to the network resources and mission requirements. In this paper, we aimed to minimize the completion time of data collection and offloading missions for all UAVs by jointly optimizing the UAV trajectories, mission mode selection, transmit power of buoys, and association relationships between the UAVs and buoy/OBS. In order to solve the mixed-integer non-convex minimization problem, we first designed a multi-agent deep reinforcement learning algorithm based on a hybrid discrete and continuous action space to preliminarily obtain the UAV trajectories, mission mode selection, and the transmit power of buoys. Then, we propose an algorithm based on the stable marriage problem to determine the buoy–UAV and UAV–OBS association relationships. Finally, the simulation results show that the proposed algorithms can effectively shorten the total mission completion time of data collection and offloading for the multi-UAV-assisted maritime IoT system.","https://www.proquest.com/docview/2767301966?accountid=44943&bdid=84593&_bd=NF2oQ%2F1lOTKvbtSDGlqfpqbZq2A%3D","https://doi.org/10.3390/rs15020292"

ASM takes form through various techniques and scales, including riverine dredging, which often targets the abundant alluvial gold deposits in South America. Remote sensing offers a solution to improve data collection, regulation, and monitoring of the more mobile and elusive ASM activities and their impacts. Mapping ASM riverine dredges using Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) is one of the application areas least explored. Three semi-automated detection approaches using Sentinel-1 SAR are compared on their ability to identify dredges with minimal false positives. The methods are: (i) Search for Unidentified Maritime Objects (SUMO), an established method for large ocean ship detection; and two techniques specifically developed for riverine environments that are introduced in this paper: (ii) a local detection method; and (iii) a global threshold method. A visual interpretation of SAR data with the inclusion of optical high-resolution data are used to generate a validation dataset. Results show it is possible to semi-automatically detect riverine dredge using SAR and that a local detection method provides the best balance between sensitivity and precision and has the lowest risk of error. Future improvements may consider further automation, more discriminatory variables, and analyzing the methods in different environments and at higher spatial resolutions.","https://www.proquest.com/docview/2904925399?accountid=44943&bdid=84593&_bd=QPd%2BGn9zupEgtQ5Tmh1i7PDSwwU%3D","https://doi.org/10.3390/rs15245701"

Currently, ship communication status analysis heavily relies on large-scale, multi-source heterogeneous data with spatio-temporal and multi-modal features, which presents challenges for ship communication quality prediction tasks. To address this issue, this paper constructs a multi-modal spatio-temporal ontology and a multi-modal spatio-temporal knowledge graph for ship communication, guided by existing ontologies and domain knowledge. This approach effectively integrates multi-modal spatio-temporal data, providing support for subsequent efficient data analysis and applications. Taking the scenario of fishing vessel communication activities as an example, the query tasks for ship communication knowledge are successfully performed using a graph database, and we combine the spatio-temporal knowledge graph with graph convolutional neural network technology to achieve real-time communication quality prediction for fishing vessels, further validating the practical value of the multi-modal spatio-temporal knowledge graph.","https://www.proquest.com/docview/2856803993?accountid=44943&bdid=84593&_bd=6IyDoYLsT2%2ByogySo47i6MZfNLM%3D","https://doi.org/10.3390/app13169393"

The estimated parameters are chlorophyll-a, total suspended matter (TSM), and chromophoric dissolved organic matter (CDOM). The Sentinel-3 OLCI remote sensing imageries were analyzed for the duration of October 2018 to February 2019. We observed that the water quality of the Hooghly estuaries is comparatively low-oxygenated, mesotrophic, and phosphate-limited. Ongoing channel dredging for maintaining shipping channel depth keeps the TSM in the estuary at an elevated level, with the highest amount of TSM observed during March of 2019 (41.59g m−3) at station A, upstream point. Since the pre-monsoon season, TSM data shows a decreasing trend towards the mouth of the estuary. Chl-a concentration is higher during pre-monsoon than monsoon and post-monsoon periods, with the highest value observed in April at 1.09 mg m−3 in station D during the pre-monsoon period. The CDOM concentration was high in the middle section (January–February) and gradually decreased towards the estuary’s head and mouth. The highest CDOM was found in February at locations C and D during the pre-monsoon period. Every station shows a significant correlation among CDOM, TSM, and Chl-a measured parameters.

Such IoT applications continuously generate stream data with hidden values that need to unveiled in real time. Streaming analytics is emerging as a popular type of Big Data analytics to process large volume of stream data for IoT applications in remote regions. Built upon terrestrial-satellite integrated networks, Satellite Edge Computing (SEC) equipped with computing resource in satellites has been envisioning as a key enabling technology to timely analyze stream data of IoT applications in remote regions on the Earth. Considering the dynamically-moving property of satellites in an SEC network, it is vital to optimize the responsiveness of each Big Data analytical query, such that none of such queries takes much longer time to wait for available satellites with sufficient computing resource. Furthermore, the uncertain data volumes of Big Data queries in SEC networks make the resources in satellites fragmented, particularly when the collaboration among satellites is intermittent. Therefore, directly application of existing methods may not guarantee the timelineness of streaming analytics in an SEC network. To address the afore-mentioned unique challenges of streaming analytics in SEC networks, it is urgent to design new algorithms and methods for timely Big Data processing. Specifically, we use the flow time to capture the responsiveness of streaming analytics in satellite edge computing, which is the time between the generation of the first unit of a dataset and the finish time of the data processing. We consider the flow time minimization problem for query evaluation of Big Data analytics in an SEC network with the aim of minimizing the average flow time of Big Data analytical queries, under an assumption of uncertain volumes of datasets. To this end, we first propose an approximation algorithm with a provable approximation ratio for the offline version of the flow time minimization problem. We then devise an online learning algorithm, referred to the customized Lipschitz bandit learning algorithm, with a bounded regret for the online version of the problem. We finally evaluate the performance of the proposed algorithms in a real SEC network topology. Experiment results show that the performance of the proposed algorithm outperforms its counterparts by at least 13% in terms of flow time.","https://www.proquest.com/docview/2895011431?accountid=44943&bdid=84593&_bd=WEa2Cu3fg8J%2BA7fzsII6BMB8kK0%3D","https://doi.org/10.1109/TPDS.2023.3332333"

The concept of smart ports, for instance, aims to adopt modern information technologies to enable a better planning and management within and between ports. Strong facilitators of the digitalization are investments into technology and cooperations for promoting information sharing and a better coordination and collaboration, often regarded as a stumbling block in highly competitive environments. Besides many new opportunities, important economic issues and problems arise. We provide an overview of the development and state-of-the-art of digital transformation in modern seaports in order to identify current potentials and barriers. Focusing on the crucial and challenging aspects of coordination and collaboration, we present a conceptual game theoretic framework that allows benefits and cost allocations considering inter-, intra-, and meta-organizational perspectives.

Of particular interest to our country are researches studying climate change in the Arctic and the consequences of these changes. One of the effects of climate change is the retreat of Arctic ice to the North. Thereby, it becomes possible to more effectively use the Northern Sea Route. The Northern Sea Route is very promising both economically and strategically. Therefore, its development and active use is an important task for the state. However, there are a large variety of obstacles and problems related to the effective development of the Northern Sea Route. One of the most important is the underdevelopment of transport and logistics infrastructure, as well as insufficient digitalization of the basic services required for safe navigation in the difficult conditions of the Arctic zone of the Russian Federation. In this context, the digitalization of Arctic shipping along the Northern Sea Route is an urgent task. The aim of the study is to develop approaches, methods and tools to ensure the digital transformation of Arctic shipping. Such infrastructure elements as Arctic ports, as well as services for ice and pilotage of vessels are considered separately. As the main research methods, we selected system analysis, conceptual modeling, ontological modeling and engineering. Two ontologies are presented as scientific and practical results obtained in the work: the ontology of the Arctic seaports of Russia and the ontology of shipping support in the waters of the Northern Sea Route. The paper also considers several promising directions for the development of the results obtained. One of these directions is related to the digitization of the most important components of the transport and logistics system for shipping along the northern coasts of the Russian Federation. This will provide better access to maritime transport infrastructure along the Arctic routes through the use of a single digital platform.

To formulate such policies, the views of professional seafarers and scholars are sometimes solicited, but the opinions of industry entrants are often neglected. However, the latter may also have some interesting views on the future of their profession, which may be relevant to policy-makers. The results of a worldwide survey, conducted using the Computer-Assisted Web Interviewing (CAWI) method, suggest that the future generation of seafarers fears automation less than their mentors. Although they expect their skills to be useful in automation-driven shipping, they also feel that their Maritime Education and Training institutions (MET) are not doing enough to prepare them for the challenges that the future may hold. This may be due to a lack or poor coverage of shipping autonomization issues in MET curricula, which was mentioned by as many as 41.9% of the respondents.

From exploratory factor analysis, the results suggest that the extensive barriers can be parsimoniously represented by five factors. The first factor relates to the lack of trust and commitment because of the display of scepticism and opportunistic behaviour. The second factor is related to resistance to change which is a result of complacency and individualism. The third factor corresponds to the incompatibility of operating and strategic goals, which is caused by inadequate supply chain leadership and poor partner selection. The fourth factor pertains to the lack of resources. This issue is pertinent to small firms and those operating in numerous parallel logistics chains. Finally, the last factor relates to measurement failure.

The introduction of podded drive propulsion systems, self-unloading bulk carriers, and increasing use of automation in port operations are indicative of a technological paradigm shift in which the human element becomes increasing devalued potentially creating legal conundrums in traditional notions of obligations and liabilities. Many 'relational' difficulties attend the interaction between law and technology. This is often exacerbated when laws obstinately remain stationary and fail to anticipate potential legal quagmires. The nature of current and emergent technology in ports may distort extant international maritime law notions of obligations and liabilities diminishing their utility or worse rendering them otiose. Giving the status of ports as enablers of global economic growth, the rapid growth of automation in ports, and the utility of international maritime law in prescribing consensus-driven international legal norms and rules for ports, it is important to examine how extant international maritime law rules on port operations hold up in automated ports. Thus this paper employs a legal doctrinal approach to critically evaluate major obligations and liability provisions on international maritime law and suggest ways in which these provisions can flow with the 'technological tide' of increasing automation.","https://www.proquest.com/docview/1852730130?accountid=44943&bdid=84593&_bd=FQFuws0SyULZYEjcvTbAOAnnfZY%3D","https://doi.org/10.1080/18366503.2016.1217379"

Whenever available, computer models greatly assist in it. However, some aspects, such as pollutant emissions, are difficult to model, leaving no other option than to test. Validating plausible options before building the powertrain prototype has the potential of accelerating the vehicle development even more, doing so without shipping components around the world. This work concerns the design of a system to virtually couple—that is, avoiding physical contact—geographically distant test rigs in order to evaluate the components of a powertrain. In the past, methods have been attempted, either with or without assistance of mathematical models of the coupled components (observers). Existing methods are accurate only when the dynamics of the systems to couple are slow in relation to the communication delay. Also, existing methods seem to overlook the implications of operating a distributed system without a common time frame. In order to overcome the inherent latency arising from long-range communication, the proposed design combines two features: The exploitation of synchronized clocks for the simultaneous introduction of setpoint commands and the use of observers generated through machine learning algorithms. This novel design is subsequently tested in two scenarios: A simple one, involving the virtual coupling of two parts of an elementary device formed by three rotating inertias, and a more complex one, the coupling between an internal combustion engine and an electric motor/generator as representative of a series or parallel hybrid powertrain. Although the results are heavily influenced by the quality of the data-generated observers, the architecture improves the fidelity of the coupling by nearly an order of magnitude compared to the alternative of directly transmitting the signals. It also opens a niche application that leverages the accuracy of low-fidelity models.","https://www.proquest.com/docview/2817872202?accountid=44943&bdid=84593&_bd=CORTNLQHpwvRTayqqgRV4i6g0fo%3D",""

Previous research that can take advantages of both ethnographic studies and big data analytics to understand factors contributing to fuel consumption and seek solutions to support decision making is rather scarce. This paper first employed ethnographic research regarding the use of a commercially available fuel-monitoring system. This was to contextualize the real challenges on ships and informed the need of taking a big data approach to achieve energy efficiency (EE). Then this study constructed two machine-learning models based on the recorded voyage data of five different ferries over a one-year period. The evaluation showed that the models generalize well on different training data sets and model outputs indicated a potential for better performance than the existing commercial EE system. How this predictive-analytical approach could potentially impact the design of decision support navigational systems and management practices was also discussed. It is hoped that this interdisciplinary research could provide some enlightenment for a richer methodological framework in future maritime energy research.","https://www.proquest.com/docview/2383275414?accountid=44943&bdid=84593&_bd=0agYoyA6fsmn9wflCh0VSAtMr7M%3D","https://doi.org/10.3390/app10062134"

Coconut Creek (Florida), ISSN 0749-0208.Vietnam is a typical coastal country bordering China, Laos, and Cambodia that possesses numerous seaborne transport facilities along the coast and two main river deltas (the Mekong River Delta and Red River Delta). Vietnam's ports and shipping flows were incorporated into a maritime network model. Vietnam's coast is on the Pacific Ocean, so the clustering method is a good way to formulate and investigate the maritime network. On the land side facing Laos and bordering China and Cambodia, Vietnam's maritime network can provide gateways for Laos, Thailand, Cambodia, and even China. Based on a big-data port and shipping system, this study focuses on the interaction between Vietnam's inland and coastal networks and the impact of throughflow as a sea gateway for Laos to connect the world. This analysis includes network connectivity, port positions and evolution, maritime port clusters, and regional deltas using clustering methods. The relationship between the maritime networks and the economic zones of Vietnam and its neighbors was also included in the current study.

"Maritime Homeland Security and the Role of Area Maritime Security Committees","","Crowell, Ben","Homeland Security Affairs","Scholarly Journals","","","","2018-12-01","Dec 2018","n/a","","","1558643X","","","ENG","Throughout the history of the United States, the country has been highly dependent upon the safe and secure transportation of goods and services on the world’s oceans. As the shipping industry and the sophistication of national and international laws have developed, the complexity and challenges of maritime security have grown. Traditionally, the concept of maritime security has referred to the military actions that nations take to secure critical sea lines of communication against interference from other military or sub-national groups. Today, maritime security involves the military, police, legislative, and policy actions that nations take domestically and internationally to ensure the safety and security of the maritime domain.[1] These tools of government are used to combat six threats that the United Nations has identified as the most significant security concerns to the maritime domain: the trafficking of persons, drugs, and weapons; maritime terrorism; crime; and piracy.[2] The U.S. Coast Guard also identifies cybersecurity, active shooters, and the emergence of drones as threats. To address these issues, the maritime homeland security enterprise has evolved into a series of overlapping authorities and jurisdictions with each layer of government employing their legal and operational tools to tackle these challenges.When evaluating these threats to the United States, maritime crime, terrorism, smuggling, and cybersecurity are the most pressing issues facing the maritime homeland security enterprise. To address these challenges following the attacks of 9/11, Congress passed the Maritime Transportation Security Act of 2002, which created regional Area Maritime Security Committees (AMSCs) led by the Coast Guard’s Captain of the Port, who is designated as the federal maritime security coordinator.[3] AMSCs are voluntary, public–private partnerships composed of representatives from the security sector and private industry such as police, fire, maritime industry, labor, and academia.[4] The purpose of AMSCs is to identify natural and manmade threats to the maritime transportation system and build and exercise response plans to counter these challenges. Interestingly, there is very little academic research or evaluation of their effectiveness. To evaluate the impact of AMSCs, this thesis posed two research questions: 1) What are the strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats surrounding AMSCs and the maritime homeland security environment? 2) How can AMSCs prioritize their efforts and improve the quality of their collaboration to achieve clear benchmarks of success? To answer these research questions, a two-round Delphi survey was administered to 24 maritime homeland security professionals across the five COTP zones along the West Coast of the United States. The data collected were then cross-referenced with the 2016 and 2017 annual reports for AMSCs.The survey identified the strengths of AMSCs as networked collaboration and information sharing; the weaknesses included the geographic distance between port facilities, bureaucracy, and personnel turnover within the Coast Guard’s leadership. The opportunities include improving information sharing, and the threats to effectiveness were a lack of participation from outlying ports, collaboration, and geography. Given that collaboration across disparate homeland security professionals is crucial for AMSC effectiveness, the inter-organizational collaboration capacity (ICC) model was selected to target opportunities for improvement. This model was chosen because of its simplicity and clarity—with five domains and 13 sub-factors that break down the means to enhance interagency performance. Following the application of the ICC model, several recommendations emerged for ways to improve the effectiveness of the committees: increase funding, remove the prohibition of funding for travel of committee members, develop a uniform method of recruiting and training new members, and build performance metrics for AMSCs. At the national level, many AMSCs face similar security threats. These issues should be identified as key security concerns with performance milestones attached to threat reduction.In summary, there is room for organizational improvement within the AMSC construct. Nevertheless, by conducting threat assessments and exercises with multiple organizations, AMSCs provide great value to the homeland security enterprise. These networked relationships and connections are the true strength of these partnerships, and AMSCs continue to build the security infrastructure surrounding the maritime transportation system.[1] Natalie Klein, Maritime Security and the Law of the Sea (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2011), 2.[2] United Nations General Assembly, Addendum to Oceans and the Law of the Sea: Report of the Secretary-General, A/72/70 (New York: United Nations, September 6, 2017), 8, http://undocs.org/A/72/70/ Add.1.[3] Maritime Transportation Security Act of 2002, Pub.

Unavoidably, such highly interconnected and interdependent systems increase the exposure of the vessel’s digital infrastructure to cyber attacks and cyber security risks. In this paper, we leverage the STRIDE and DREAD methodologies to qualitatively and quantitatively assess the cyber risk of Cyber Physical Systems on board digitalized contemporary and future ships. Further, we propose appropriate cyber security baseline controls to mitigate such risks, by applying a systematic approach using a set of criteria that take into account the security requirements; the cyber risks; the possible attacks; and the possibly already existing controls, to select from the list of controls provided in the Industrial Control Systems (ICS) overlay of the NIST Guide to ICS Security.

The need to improve the efficiency, safety, and sustainability of operations is leading to a strong demand for automation in port processes. A significant challenge is the optimization and automation of loading and unloading systems, given their complexity and repetitive nature. Advances in automated systems, through ongoing research and application in various transportation scenarios, are addressing these challenges. However, automating vehicles alone is insufficient; it is also important to have a connected, infrastructure-based collaborative framework to manage the complex logistics of port operations effectively and in a synchronized manner. In this sense, ESTIBA+2022, a Spanish-funded project, is addressing this challenge, aiming to develop strategic technologies for Smart-Ports. Its goal is to design and validate a scalable collaborative framework that meets the specifications and functions of port services using Industry 4.0 technologies and advanced wireless communications through Connected Intelligent Transportation Systems (C-ITS). This article presents the proposed architecture and its validation in the comprehensive use case of the project, focusing on communication from the supervision platform to Automated Guided Vehicles (AGVs) to ensure optimal traffic flow and management in ports. Specifically, the scenario involves three different forklifts equipped with an On-Board Unit (OBU) that interact with each other and the infrastructure via Roadside Units (RSU). The outcome of the project shows that the framework can meet the requirements for Smart-Port logistics, showing the feasibility of the implementation with a collaborative maneuver between three forklifts, a supervision station, and connected traffic lights.","https://www.proquest.com/docview/3101348758?accountid=44943&bdid=84593&_bd=Qk2XhZEPBNvIb%2BB9psSmWojHQYs%3D","https://doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2024.3434628"

In the case of container ships, there may be various operating patterns employed to arrive at the destination within the stipulated time. In addition, depending on the influence of the ocean’s environmental conditions, the speed and the route can be changed. As the ship’s fuel oil consumption is closely related to its operational pattern, it is possible to identify the most economical operations by analyzing the operational patterns of the ships. The operational records of each shipping company are not usually disclosed, so it is necessary to estimate the operational characteristics from publicly available data such as the automatic identification system (AIS) data and ocean environment data. In this study, we developed a visualization program to analyze the AIS data and ocean environmental conditions together and propose two categories of applications for the operational analysis of container ships using maritime big data. The first category applications are the past operation analysis by tracking previous trajectories, and the second category applications are the speed pattern analysis by shipping companies and shipyards under harsh environmental conditions.

Among the different directives of IMO, currently especially the sulphur emission regulations pose challenges for the shipping industry. Related to this are the established Sulphur Emission Control Areas (SECAs) and the introduced global sulphur cap. To comply with the sulphur restrictions, according to the present technological state of the art, ship-owners have three options for their existing fleet: the installation of emission abatement technologies, the switch to low sulphur fuels, or retrofitting for the usage of alternative fuels. Regardless which option is favoured, most often selected solutions still depend on fossil fuels. The reasons for this can be traced back to the fact that supply of biofuels is not ensured in ports and generally seen as no profitable solution. This paper develops and examines an innovative business model with a special focus on liquefied biogas (LBG). The study bases on collected qualitative and quantitative data, which was used by applying the Business Model Canvas. The results will highlight that the business model bears the potential to promote LBG supply. Next to this, the research will show that blockchain and smart contracts are able to foster the implementation of the business model and optimisation of value chain operations.

Trajectory data consist of samples that include temporal, spatial, and other descriptive features of object movements. One of the main challenges in trajectory data analysis is to divide trajectory data into meaningful segments based on certain criteria. Most of the available segmentation algorithms are limited to processing data offline, i.e., they cannot segment a stream of trajectory samples. In this work, we propose an approach called Reactive Buffering Window - Trajectory Segmentation (RBW-TS), which partitions trajectory data into segments while receiving a stream of trajectory samples. Another novelty compared to existing work is that the proposed algorithm is based on multidimensional features of trajectories, and it can incorporate as many relevant features of the underlying trajectory as needed. This makes RBW-TS general and applicable to numerous domains by simply selecting trajectory features relevant for segmentation purposes. The proposed online algorithm incurs lower computational and memory requirements. Furthermore, it is robust to noisy samples and outliers. We validate RBW-TS on three use cases: (a) segmenting human-movement trajectories in different modes of transportation, (b) segmenting trajectories generated by vessels in the maritime domain, and (c) segmenting human-movement trajectories in a commercial shopping center. The numerical results detailed in the paper demonstrate that (i) RBW-TS is capable of detecting the true breakpoints of segments in all three usecases while processing a stream of trajectory points; (ii) despite low memory and computational requirements, the performance in terms of the harmonic mean of purity and coverage is comparable to that of state-of-the-art batch and online algorithms; (iii) RBW-TS achieves different levels of accuracy depending on the various internal parameter estimation methods used; and (iv) RBW-TS can tackle real-world trajectory data for segmentation purposes.","https://www.proquest.com/docview/2841213173?accountid=44943&bdid=84593&_bd=%2F5c6Rup419sN3LCMlFnOxnOvYXE%3D","https://doi.org/10.1186/s40537-023-00799-0"

However, there is a tendency for the profit margins of shipping companies to reduce due to an increase in operational costs, and it does not seem that this trend will change in the near future. The most important reason for the increase in operating costs relates to the increase in fuel prices. To compensate for the increase in operating costs, shipping companies can either renew their fleet or try to make use of new technologies to optimize the performance of their existing one. The software structure in the maritime industry has changed and is now leaning towards the use of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and, more specifically, Machine Learning (ML) for calculating its operational scenarios as a way to compensate the reduction of profit. While AI is a technology for creating intelligent systems that can simulate human intelligence, ML is a subfield of AI, which enables machines to learn from past data without being explicitly programmed. ML has been used in other industries for increasing both availability and profitability, and it seems that there is also great potential for the maritime industry. In this paper the authors compares the performance of multiple regression algorithms like Artificial Neural Network (ANN), Tree Regressor (TRs), Random Forest Regressor (RFR), K-Nearest Neighbor (kNN), Linear Regression, and AdaBoost, in predicting the output power of the Main Engines (M/E) of an ocean going vessel. These regression algorithms are selected because they are commonly used and are well supported by the main software developers in the area of ML. For this scope, measured values that are collected from the onboard Automated Data Logging & Monitoring (ADLM) system of the vessel for a period of six months have been used.

However, this means the sea lanes are becoming more and more crowded, leading to high probabilities of marine accidents in complex maritime environments. According to relevant historical statistics, a large number of accidents have happened in water areas that lack high precision navigation data, which can be utilized to enhance navigation safety. The purpose of this work was to carry out ship route planning automatically, by mining historical big automatic identification system (AIS) data. It is well-known that experiential navigation information hidden in maritime big data could be automatically extracted using advanced data mining techniques; assisting in the generation of safe and reliable ship planning routes for complex maritime environments. In this paper, a novel method is proposed to construct a big data-driven framework for generating ship planning routes automatically, under varying navigation conditions. The method performs density-based spatial clustering of applications with noise first on a large number of ship trajectories to form different trajectory vector clusters. Then, it iteratively calculates its centerline in the trajectory vector cluster, and constructs the waterway network from the node-arc topology relationship among these centerlines. The generation of shipping route could be based on the waterway network and conducted by rasterizing the marine environment risks for the sea area not covered by the waterway network.

Since the modes of freight transport differ substantially, the purpose of this article is to compare the contextual differences among IoT adoption drivers in road, rail, and maritime freight transport and assess the suitability of different modes of freight transport for IoT adoption. The identified drivers for IoT adoption are classified under the technology, organization, and environmental framework, and the relative weight of drivers for road, rail, and maritime freight transport are compared using fuzzy analytic network process method. The most important drivers for freight transport are competitive advantage, management support (MGS), and security and privacy.

To enhance the application of blockchain in the shipping industry, a vertical game model is constructed, involving a port and a shipping company (SP), to analyze the roles of maritime stakeholders and cooperative investment strategies. The study also investigates the impact of time value, investment cost, and blockchain operating cost on price, demand, and profit. Comparative analyses and numerical experiments provide insights into the equilibrium strategy and “free ride” behavior among stakeholders in blockchain adoption. Results indicate: (1) When the time value is higher, investment in blockchain benefits the SP regardless of the blockchain operating cost. The high-efficiency port (HP) should cooperate with the high-time-value SP in blockchain technology investment, while the low-efficiency port (LP) should cooperate with the low-time-value SP. (2) When the blockchain operating cost is lower, the port and the SP are more inclined to cooperate in blockchain technology investment. As the blockchain operating cost increases, the SP becomes proactive in investing to drive blockchain adoption, while the port “free rides”. The SP only exhibits a “free ride” motive when the time cost is low. These findings offer valuable insights for maritime stakeholders in making decisions regarding blockchain adoption.","https://www.proquest.com/docview/3060207038?accountid=44943&bdid=84593&_bd=KlpU04UINrqGT7H1A6q8r5flVUs%3D","https://doi.org/10.1007/s12351-024-00839-4"

Still, the exchange of training data might raise privacy concerns of the involved stakeholders. Towards this end, federated learning (FL), a decentralized ML approach, enables collaborative model training across multiple distributed edge devices, such as on-board sensors and unmanned vessels and vehicles. In this work, we explore the integration of FL into PdM to support Shipping 4.0 applications, by using real datasets from the maritime sector. More specifically, we present the main FL principles, the proposed workflow and then, we evaluate and compare various FL algorithms in three maritime use cases, i.e. regression to predict the naval propulsion gas turbine (GT) measures, classification to predict the ship engine condition, and time-series regression to predict ship fuel consumption. The efficiency of the proposed FL-based PdM highlights its ability to improve maintenance decision-making, reduce downtime in the shipping industry, and enhance the operational efficiency of shipping fleets.

These cyber security threats and risks as well as a number of known security breach scenarios are described in this paper to highlight the evolution of cyber physical systems in the maritime domain and their emerging cyber vulnerabilities. Current industry and governmental standards and directives related to cyber security in the maritime domain attempt to enforce the regulatory compliance and reinforce asset cyber security integrity for optimum and safe performance with limited focus, however, in the existing OT infrastructure and systems. The use of outside-of-the-maritime industry security risk assessment tools and processes, such the API STD 780 Security Risk Assessment (SRA) and the Bow Tie Analysis methodologies, can assist the asset owner to assess its IT and OT infrastructure for cyber and physical security vulnerabilities and allocate proper mitigation measures assuming their similarities to ICS infrastructure. The application of cyber security controls deriving from the adaptation of the NIST CSF and the MITRE ATT&CK Threat Model can further increase the cyber security integrity of maritime assets, assuming they are periodically evaluated for their effectiveness and applicability. Finally, the improvement in communication among stakeholders, the increase in operational and technical cyber and physical security resiliency, and the increase in operational cyber security awareness would be further increased for maritime assets by the convergence of the distinct physical and cyber security functions as well as onshore- and offshore-based cyber infrastructure of maritime companies and asset owners.","https://www.proquest.com/docview/2612805152?accountid=44943&bdid=84593&_bd=qoDSsBSd%2FRdBj4vyhOvyYe4Ozqg%3D","https://doi.org/10.3390/jmse9121384"

Since 1990, global container traffic has grown by an average of 10% annually. Equally, the steady growth of ship sizes poses major logistical and technical problems worldwide. Given these facts, shipping and maritime logistics would largely benefit from Big Data as well as the emerging digital technologies. Apart from the many positive effects of digitization in maritime logistics with respect to efficiency, safety and energy saving, there are, however, also risks (e.g. data abuse, cybercrime). Based on a systematic literature review, this article provides an overview of the current state of digitization in maritime logistics, discusses existing problem areas, and shows potential for improvement. The results show that it is essential to capture the development potential in order to be able to benefit from the advantages.

Researchers have been working constantly and facing challenges to automatically detect ships, mainly in remote sensing, which has shown a great impact in providing safety, detecting illegal trade, pollution, and oil slick monitoring. In this paper, 192,555 satellite images of ships have been used to train the deep learning models such as customized CNN, ResNet152V2, InceptionResNetV2, MobileNetV2, NasNetLarge, DenseNet201, and EfficientNetB7. The dataset has been first pre-processed to remove any noisy signals before being graphically represented using exploratory data analysis to study the pixel intensities of data. Later, feature extraction techniques such as image masking, image augmentation, and contour features are applied to create bounding boxes corresponding to the detected ship’s localizing coordinates. The models are further evaluated using the ship detected and ship not detected classes. It has been discovered that customized CNN achieved the highest precision by 96.16 as well as 95.64 and F1 score value by 99.89 and 95.99 in terms of both the classes, respectively.

In recent years, the food traceability mechanism has become one of the emerging blockchain applications in order to improve the anti-counterfeiting area’s quality. Many food manufacturing systems have a low level of readability, scalability, and data accuracy. Similarly, this process is complicated in the supply chain and needs a lot of time for processing. The blockchain system creates a new ontology in the traceability system supply chain to deal with these issues. In this paper, a blockchain machine learning-based food traceability system (BMLFTS) is proposed in order to combine the new extension in blockchain, Machine Learning technology (ML), and fuzzy logic traceability system that is based on the shelf life management system for manipulating perishable food. The blockchain technology in the proposed system has been developed in order to address light-weight, evaporation, warehouse transactions, or shipping time. The blockchain data flow is designed to show the extension of ML at the level of food traceability.

A special cargo ontology is a means of extracting, structuring, and storing domain knowledge and representing the concepts and relationships that can be processed by computers. This ontology can be used as the base of semantic data retrieval in many artificial intelligence applications, such as planning for special cargo shipments. Domain information extraction is an essential task in implementing and maintaining special cargo ontology. However, the absence of domain information makes instantiating the cargo ontology challenging. We propose a relation representation learning approach based on a hierarchical attention-based multi-task model and leverage it in the special cargo domain. The proposed relation representation learning architecture is applied for identifying and categorizing samples of various relation types in the special cargo ontology. The model is trained with domain-specific documents on a number of semantic tasks that vary from lightweight tasks in the bottom layers to the heavyweight tasks in the top layers of the model in a hierarchical setting. Therefore, it conveys complementary input features and learns a rich representation. We also train a domain-specific relation representation model that relies only on an entity-linked corpus of cargo shipment domain. These two relation representation models are then employed in a supervised multi-class classifier called Special Cargo Relation Extractor (SCRE). The results of the experiments show that the proposed relation representation models can represent the complex semantic information of the special cargo domain efficiently.","https://www.proquest.com/docview/2850405706?accountid=44943&bdid=84593&_bd=1I6%2BgmSGOmEiKHxLZGTnBJU%2B9Z4%3D","https://doi.org/10.1007/s00521-023-08704-9"

This research aims at evaluating the relationship among the critical dimensions influencing cybersecurity performance in the maritime industry. To achieve this, six critical dimensions related to cybersecurity preparedness are first identified through literature review, namely ‘regulations’, ‘company procedures’ from a managerial perspective and ‘shipboard systems readiness’, ‘training and awareness’, ‘human factor’ and ‘compliance monitoring’ at an operation level. A Likert-scale questionnaire is designed and used to collect empirical data from 133 seafarers and shore-based staff. Structural Equation Modelling (SEM) is applied to examine the causal relationships between the six dimensions and shipboard cybersecurity performance. The results show that ‘regulations’ positively influence shipping companies’ cybersecurity-related ‘procedures’, which in turn positively affects ‘shipboard systems readiness’, ‘training and awareness’, and ‘monitoring’.

An important aspect of sea transport is the organization of freight. In particular, the maritime freight network is a large complex system whose complexity of route maps and the variety of ship traffic render it difficult to model. When investigating the characteristics of the sea freight system, it is generally advisable to use rough models in which only significant approximations are introduced and a number of details are not taken into account. At the same time, an exact model is used in a detailed study of isolated areas of the network wherein it is the area which is explored in detail and not the connections between the said areas. By so doing, one should be careful not to overlook the deviations of the model from the real network in the first case and the connections between areas in the second.Building a model that accurately takes into account and describes all the details results in excessive complications in the design process, so, in practice, a number of assumptions are always used in the simulation which are basically approximations of the real characteristics related to ship movement, depending on the specific task. Four models are used in order to build an optimal cargo transportation system: Transnational cargo model; model of cargo transportation with a dedicated initial port of cargo departure; model of cargo transportation with dedicated initial ports of departure and final port of cargo distribution; model of cargo transportation on a circular chain of ports. The route conditions are given by the traveling wave equation and on the basis of these calculations the optimal route of cargo ship movement is put forth whereby conditions affecting freight traffic include: Number of ports, fuel quantity, port of cargo destination, as well as distances between ports and intermediate ports of call. The scientific contribution lies in the fact that the human role is reduced only to that of the system observer, which, in turn, simplifies the freight calculations, as well as helps reduce the cost of fuel and human resources.","https://www.proquest.com/docview/2379197362?accountid=44943&bdid=84593&_bd=YietWOb%2FG7zFeek6kLXAr5sUhwc%3D","https://doi.org/10.3390/jmse8030201"

To help port communities better comprehend smart port concepts and successfully develop a smart port within a global supply chain, this paper synthesizes core smart port concepts, designs underlying architecture, and proposes specific milestones for monitoring the smart port development project.

The developed tool utilises machine learning and operations research algorithms, to forecast and optimize bulk spare parts orders needed to cover planned maintenance requirements on an annual basis and optimize the company’s purchasing decisions.Design/methodology/approach: The proposed approach consists of three discrete methodological steps, each one supported by a decision support tool based on clustering and machine learning algorithms. In the first step, clustering is applied in order to identify high interest items. Next, a forecasting tool is developed for estimating the expected needs of the fleet and to test whether the needed quantity is influenced by the source of purchase. Finally, the selected items are cost-effectively allocated to a group of vendors. The performance of the tool is assessed by running a simulation of a bulk order process on a mixed fleet totaling 75 vessels.Findings: The overall findings and approach are quite promising Indicatively, shifting demand planning focus to critical spares, via clustering, can reduce administrative workload.

However, maritime communications are still characterized by slow communication speeds and limited communication capacity, despite a similar trend of increasing demand for information exchange. These limitations are particularly evident in digital data exchange, which is still limited to relatively slow and expensive narrowband satellite transmission. Furthermore, with the increasing digitalization of ships and introducing the sustainable concept of autonomous ship operation, large amounts of collected data need to be transmitted in real-time to enable remote voyage monitoring and control, putting additional pressure on the already strained means of maritime communications. In this paper, an adaptive shipboard data compression method based on differential binary encoding is proposed for real-time maritime data transmission. The proposed approach is verified on the actual data collected on board a training ship equipped with the latest data acquisition system. The obtained results show that the proposed data encoding method efficiently reduces the transmitted data size to an average of 3.4% of the original shipboard data, thus significantly reducing the required data transmission rate. Moreover, the proposed method outperforms several other tested competing methods for shipboard data encoding by up to 69.6% in terms of compression efficiency. Therefore, this study suggests that the proposed data compression approach can be a viable and efficient solution for transmitting large amounts of digital shipboard data in sustainable maritime real-time communications.","https://www.proquest.com/docview/2558944476?accountid=44943&bdid=84593&_bd=0ar%2FJ1ILdO5H2mFUZbVWP5eMX%2F4%3D","https://doi.org/10.3390/su13158264"

In this study, we explore how varied port governance of port authorities may impact the smart port development strategy. First, we established a set of evaluation criteria, using the Borda count and fuzzy analytic hierarchy process, to obtain the key indicators for the development of smart ports in Taiwan. Then, we compared the preferred indicators of Taiwan’s smart port development strategy with those of Spanish ports. An obvious difference in this ranking comparison is found. This indicates that Taiwan’s strategy focuses on optimizing maritime safety, while Spain’s strategy focuses on improving operational economics. Finally, we analyzed the differences between the smart port development strategies of these two countries using the latest port governance classification table. The results of the above analysis are also verified by comparing the differences in port legislation between them. It turns out that the private sector is deeply involved in the operation of ports in Taiwan compared with Spain.

"Comparison of Machine Learning Models in Simulating Glacier Mass Balance: Insights from Maritime and Continental Glaciers in High Mountain Asia","","Ren, Weiwei; Zhu, Zhongzheng; Wang, Yingzheng; Su, Jianbin; Zeng, Ruijie; Zheng, Donghai; Li, Xin","Remote Sensing","Undefined","Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute","16","6","2024-03-08","Mar 8, 2024","","","","2072-4292","2072-4292","","ENG","Accurately simulating glacier mass balance (GMB) data is crucial for assessing the impacts of climate change on glacier dynamics. Since physical models often face challenges in comprehensively accounting for factors influencing glacial melt and uncertainties in inputs, machine learning (ML) offers a viable alternative due to its robust flexibility and nonlinear fitting capability. However, the effectiveness of ML in modeling GMB data across diverse glacier types within High Mountain Asia has not yet been thoroughly explored. This study addresses this research gap by evaluating ML models used for the simulation of annual glacier-wide GMB data, with a specific focus on comparing maritime glaciers in the Niyang River basin and continental glaciers in the Manas River basin. For this purpose, meteorological predictive factors derived from monthly ERA5-Land datasets, and topographical predictive factors obtained from the Randolph Glacier Inventory, along with target GMB data rooted in geodetic mass balance observations, were employed to drive four selective ML models: the random forest model, the gradient boosting decision tree (GBDT) model, the deep neural network model, and the ordinary least-square linear regression model. The results highlighted that ML models generally exhibit superior performance in the simulation of GMB data for continental glaciers compared to maritime ones. Moreover, among the four ML models, the GBDT model was found to consistently exhibit superior performance with coefficient of determination (R2) values of 0.72 and 0.67 and root mean squared error (RMSE) values of 0.21 m w.e. and 0.30 m w.e. for glaciers within Manas and Niyang river basins, respectively. Furthermore, this study reveals that topographical and climatic factors differentially influence GMB simulations in maritime and continental glaciers, providing key insights into glacier dynamics in response to climate change. In summary, ML, particularly the GBDT model, demonstrates significant potential in GMB simulation. Moreover, the application of ML can enhance the accuracy of GMB modeling, providing a promising approach to assess the impacts of climate change on glacier dynamics.","https://www.proquest.com/docview/3040463298?accountid=44943&bdid=84593&_bd=7f3U4sL6x5OXDJnotOYeVC%2BevlI%3D","https://doi.org/10.3390/rs16060956"

This article investigates three primary aspects: (1) the current state of cybersecurity onboard cargo vessels, (2) seafarers’ cybersecurity awareness, and (3) potential improvements in seafarers’ cybersecurity awareness. To accomplish this, a literature review is conducted to collect and analyze current research, supplemented by a questionnaire survey targeting Turkish seafarers. Our findings support increased investment in awareness and training programs, including organizational-wide cybersecurity awareness efforts, more frequent training, mandatory training for all seafarers through the Standards of Training Certification and Watchkeeping (STCW), and the appointment of a cybersecurity Officer (CySO) to ensure satisfactory cybersecurity levels onboard.

Still, the majority of maritime nodes, residing in MCNs lacks reliable connectivity. Towards this end, integrating unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) in sixth generation (6G) MCN topologies results in the formation of an aerial segment, complementing shore base stations that may offer insufficient coverage, and satellite communication, characterized by increased delays. In this study, we focus on an MCN where the direct links towards a shore BS are not available, due to excessive fading conditions. For this case, we use a UAV swarm to provide improved wireless connectivity, adopting non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) for high resource efficiency. In downlink communication, UAVs take into consideration the desired service rate and the channel quality of their links towards the maritime nodes. In the uplink, UAVs employ dynamic decoding ordering to enhance the performance of successive interference cancellation, avoiding fixed ordering of the maritime nodes’ signals. Moreover, to ensure highly flexible UAV selection, UAVs are equipped with buffers to store data. Performance comparisons show that the UAV swarm-aided MCN enjoys increased average sum-rate by relying on multi-criteria-based interference cancellation and buffer-aided UAVs, over other benchmark schemes in the downlink and uplink. Finally, the delay-aware nature of the proposed algorithms where the UAV-destination links are prioritized, leads to reduced average delay.","https://www.proquest.com/docview/2924034871?accountid=44943&bdid=84593&_bd=JvmtGIbBddrOZt2BCRFXpLPzMnI%3D","https://doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2024.3360133"

Several actions are being taken to reduce the GHG emissions from maritime vessels, and integration of Renewable Energy Sources (RESs) is one of them. Ocean-going marine ships need a large amount of reliable energy to support the propulsive load. Intermittency is one of the drawbacks of RESs, and penetration of RESs in maritime vessels is limited by the cargo carrying capacity and usable area of that ship. Other types of reliable energy sources need to be incorporated in ships to overcome these shortcomings of RESs. Some researchers proposed to integrate fossil fuel-based generators like diesel generators and renewable energy in marine vessels to reduce GHG emissions. As the penetration of RESs in marine ships is limited, fossil fuel-based generators provide most of the energy. Therefore, renewable and fossil fuel-based hybrid energy systems in maritime vessels can not reduce GHG emissions to the desired level. Fossil fuel-based generators need to be replaced by emissions-free energy sources to make marine ships free from emissions. Nuclear energy is emissions-free energy, and small-scale nuclear reactors like Microreactors (MRs) are competent to replace fossil fuel-based generators. In this paper, the technical, environmental, and economic competitiveness of Nuclear-Renewable Hybrid Energy Systems (N-R HES) in marine ships are assessed. The lifecycle cost of MR, reliability of the proposed system, and limitations of integrating renewable energy in maritime vessels are considered in this study. The proposed N-R HES is compared with three different energy systems, namely ‘Standalone Fossil Fuel-based Energy Systems’, ‘Renewable and Fossil Fuel-based Hybrid Energy Systems’, and ‘Standalone Nuclear Energy System’. The cost modeling of each energy system is carried out in MATLAB simulator. Each energy system is optimized by using the Differential Evolution Algorithm (DEA), an artificial intelligence algorithm, to find out the optimal configuration of the system components in terms of Net Present Cost (NPC). The results determine that N-R HES has the lowest NPC compared to the other three energy systems. The performance of the DE algorithm is compared with another widely accepted artificial intelligence optimization technique called ‘Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO)’ to validate the findings of the DE algorithm. The impact of control parameters in the DE algorithm is assessed by employing the Adaptive Differential Evolution (ADE) algorithm. A sensitivity analysis is carried out to assess the impact of different system parameters on this study’s findings.","https://www.proquest.com/docview/2539695500?accountid=44943&bdid=84593&_bd=X7lQtMRiVOTrcC4N1VYFv3LJDAU%3D","https://doi.org/10.3390/en14113188"

Based on these studies but focusing only on the applications with a direct impact on the relationship at the very heart of marketing, i.e., the one between firms and consumers, the paper analyzes three categories of AI applications: AI-based shipping-then-shopping, AI-based service robots, and AI-based smart products and domestic robots. The main result of this first analysis is that all three categories have to do, each in their own way, with mass customization. A discussion of this common trait leads us to recognize their ways to mass customization that – unlike the traditional approach developed thanks to flexible automation and product modularity technologies – place the customization process within a broader perspective of consumer needs management. This change in approach means that marketing should focus more on managing consumers’ needs than directly on the satisfaction of those needs.

Previous studies have used a ship allocation algorithm, which only considered the ship cost (COST) along limited target routes; by contrast, in this study, a basic ship-planning support system is reinforced with particularized COST attributes and greenhouse gas (GHG) features incorporated into a ship allocation algorithm related to the International Maritime Organization GHG reduction strategy. Additionally, this system is expanded to a worldwide shipping area. Thus, we optimize the operation-level ship allocation using the existing ships by considering the COST and GHG emissions. Finally, the ship specifications demanded worldwide are ascertained by inputting the new ships instance.","https://www.proquest.com/docview/2632828987?accountid=44943&bdid=84593&_bd=FzkL8U2eY9swJ8LE%2BNACVqU3%2F2E%3D","https://doi.org/10.3390/jmse10020186"

As the chemical weathering intensity increases, hydrological, geochemical and geophysical changes occur in the different environmental spheres and at their interfaces through reactions and energy flows. Thus, once chemical weathering rates are understood and estimated, they can be used to predict and assess changes and trends in different environmental spheres. Few studies on the chemical weathering intensity have been performed in Antarctica. We used radiometric and magnetic properties associated with terrain attributes and the chemical degree of alteration of the igneous rock to model the chemical weathering intensity in Maritime Antarctica by using machine learning. Then, we related the chemical weathering intensity and geophysical variables with periglacial processes. To do this, gamma-spectrometric and magnetic readings were carried out using proximal-field sensors at 91 points located on different lithologies in a representative area of Maritime Antarctica. A qualitative analysis of chemical alteration for the different lithologies was carried out based on field observations and rock properties, and the levels of the chemical weathering degree were established. The geophysical data associated with terrain attributes were used as input data in the modeling of the weathering intensity. Then, the levels of the rock weathering degree were used as the “y” variable in the models. The results indicated that the C5.0 algorithm had the best performance in predicting the weathering intensity, and the most important variables were eTh, ⁴⁰K, ⁴⁰K/eTh, ⁴⁰K/eU, the magnetic susceptibility and terrain attributes. The contents of radionuclides and ferrimagnetic minerals in different lithologies, concomitantly with the intensity at which chemical weathering occurs, determine the contents of these elements. However, the stability and distribution of these elements in a cold periglacial environment are controlled by periglacial processes. The chemical weathering intensity prediction model using gamma-spectrometric and magnetic data matched the in situ estimate of the chemical degree of alteration of the rock. The pyritized andesites showed the highest intensities of weathering, followed by tuffites, diorites, andesitic basalts and basaltic andesites, and the lowest weathering intensity was shown by undifferentiated marine sediments. This work highlighted the suitability of using machine learning techniques and proximal-field sensor data to study the chemical weathering process on different rocks in these important and inhospitable areas of the cryosphere system.","https://www.proquest.com/docview/2849882276?accountid=44943&bdid=84593&_bd=yhHYwncnHyqFcQ41rRvPExoa1u8%3D","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.geoderma.2023.116615"

This paper investigates the development of next-generation smart ports, wherein the integration of Internet of Things (IoT) and sensors transforms ports into intelligent hubs. This transformation aims to optimize operations for all stakeholders, that leverage emerging technologies to enhance efficiency and connectivity. Notably, many smaller seaports lack shore-power facilities, shore-based power installations that supply electric power to ships from the grid. Consequently, ships often rely on continuous operation of auxiliary diesel engines and generators while at berth to meet auxiliary loads. To address these challenges and overcome economic and logistical constraints, this paper proposes a seaport microgrid (SMG) with a DC distribution that would be created by integrating multiple ships with decentralized control mechanisms supplemented by an onshore charging infrastructure. This helps to achieve a sustainable path by introducing ship-based SMGs involving the integration of shipboard microgrids with onshore charging. The proposed approach relies on adaptive droop control, decentralized power-sharing based on battery charge and reducing traditional communication dependencies. The case study supported by the simulation results shown in the paper emphasizes the potential of this strategy in the evolution of maritime infrastructure.","https://www.proquest.com/docview/3107263115?accountid=44943&bdid=84593&_bd=PkeAkpuByaGD%2Bjh4RsvqT1zQ3vw%3D","https://doi.org/10.1109/TIA.2024.3425800"

Cognitive science indicates that humans heavily weight evidence from more recent experiences.MethodParticipants monitored the behavior of maritime vessels (contacts) in order to classify them, and then received advice from automation regarding classification. Participants were assigned to either an initially high (90%) or low (60%) automation reliability condition.

After the change in true reliability, estimates in both conditions moved towards the common true reliability, but did not reach it. There were recency effects, with lower future reliability estimates immediately following incorrect automation advice. With lower initial reliability, automation acceptance rates tracked true reliability more closely than perceived reliability.

Despite the increasing trend in terminal automation, little work has been done to develop theoretical guidelines for evaluating the benefits of this industrial practice. We assess terminal automation by focusing on whether strategic content and process structure are aligned. In this study, we explore the reasons that these results are mixed in the context of service automation. Have market competitiveness and operational performance been enhanced by automation in seaports? We focus on two key strategic elements and their proper alignment to produce the best performance for a port. The first element is the overall business strategy and strategic content adopted by the port. In this study, we look at Porter’s (Competitive strategy, Free Press, New York, 1980) generic strategic classification of low cost, differentiation, or focus strategies. The second element is the process structure of the port, which may have been impacted by technological innovation. Using the framework of contingency theory, we explore the interface of strategic content and process structure and how this interface impacts the service process automation. A multiple case study is conducted on a sample of 20 container terminals, selected from the list of 2014 Journal of Commerce’s Top Productive Terminals. We come up with three important findings. First, a port’s strategic market position determines the choice of overall business strategy. If a port is strategically positioned as an international gate, then it should adopt an overall cost-leadership strategy, whereas a transshipment terminal should adopt an overall differentiation strategy. Second, we find that the process structure adopted is associated with the level of automation, and a differentiation strategy is dependent on the level of flexibility, speed, and reliability. Higher market uncertainty requires higher flexibility, while lower market uncertainty requires greater speed and reliability. Third, the level of process automation depends on throughput volume and stability. Closer relationships with maritime supply–chain partners help increase throughput volume and reduce throughput uncertainty.","https://www.proquest.com/docview/2313000229?accountid=44943&bdid=84593&_bd=E9v5%2FkXKlgSjBye9RzongP4b1G8%3D","https://doi.org/10.1057/s41278-017-0070-z"

The ships are the critical elements of the shipping. The ships are the largest vehicles of the world and equipped with state of art management systems which are mostly furnished with highly automated systems. Any automated system failure may cause fatal accidents which hamper the human life, ship and environment as well as ports and terminals. Automated systems facilitate management of the ships and reduce manpower requirement. Unfortunately the seafarers assume these high technology products are very reliable and mostly neglects any possible failure on these systems. If we investigate seafarer's education and training systems, curricula do not cover sufficient knowledge on operation principles and limitations of automated systems. This insufficiency negatively affects their counter actions in case of an automation failure which endangers safety of sea. The application of automation systems on board speedily pervades following the rapid technologic developments on merchant ships as well as on naval ships. That means automation failure will become rather important in the future. This study investigates possible reasons for automation failures and proposals to prevent it and reduce the negative effects of such incidents.

Accordingly, we propose that anonymous miners compete to solve the container truck routing problem, which seeks to find the most efficient routes for trucks. We show that this problem is NP$\mathcal{NP}$‐hard. Miners must also solve the problem of optimally matching consignees and shippers, which will reduce transportation and storage costs for empty containers.

The International Chamber of Shipping highlights the importance of exploring AI's application in other modes of transport to gain insights for its future use in shipping. The main focus for developers of AI systems across transport modes is to improve efficiency and safety. As machine learning capabilities advance, more creative solutions are being applied to address a wider range of transport-related issues. For example, Google collaborated with American Airlines to identify flight paths that would minimize pollution contrails using a combination of a contrail model, satellite imagery, weather, and flight path data. Pilots using AI models were able to reduce contrails by 54%, indicating the potential to significantly reduce aviation's contribution to global CO2 emissions. In the maritime industry, AI is seen as a differentiator for fleet performance software, which is crucial for compliance with regulations and maintaining a competitive advantage. The International Maritime Organization (IMO) is developing regulations for AI on a case-by-case basis, with a focus on autonomous vessels. The draft Maritime Autonomous Surface Ship (MASS) Code includes principles that emphasize the need for human intervention in decisions that affect fundamental human rights. The complexity of regulating AI in shipping, as well as other transport modes, poses challenges for the long-term deployment of fully automated vessels and traffic management systems.

This study aims to extract shipping routes using unsupervised machine-learning algorithms. The proposed three-step approach: maneuvering point detection, waypoint discovery, and traffic network construction was used to construct a maritime traffic network from historical AIS data, which quantitatively reflects ship characteristics by ship length and ship type, and can be used for route planning. When the constructed maritime traffic network was compared to the macroscopic ship traffic flow, the Symmetrized Segment-Path Distance (SSPD)metric returned lower values, indicating that the constructed traffic network closely resembles the routes ships transit.

To bridge this gap, our study uses AIS big data to construct a comprehensive model of the container shipping network from the perspective of multilayer, focusing on two levels: shipping alliances and shipping lines. Our findings show that while shipping lines have been competing for shipping markets fiercely, the construction of shipping alliances eases the competition among them and promotes their cooperation. The three alliances have formed a new oligopoly pattern, combining to build a complete and mature network with increased efficiency, density, and stability.

Based on the technology of Internet of things, the intelligent monitoring system of unmanned surface vessels (USV) is designed and realized, and the security technology and network technology of the Internet of things are adopted. The USV are utilized to monitor and collect information on the sea, which is critical to maritime security. Once the video data were captured by pirates and criminals during the transmission, the security of the sea will be affected awfully. The shortcomings of traditional algorithms are as follows: the encryption degree is not high, computing cost is expensive, and video data is intercepted and captured easily during the transmission process. In order to overcome the disadvantages, a novel encryption algorithm, i.e., the improved Hill encryption algorithm, is proposed to deal with the security problems of the unmanned video monitoring system in this paper. Specifically, the Hill algorithm of classical cryptography is transplanted into image encryption, using an invertible matrix as the key to realize the encryption of image matrix. The improved Hill encryption algorithm combines with the process of video compression and regulates the parameters of the encryption process according to the content of the video image and overcomes the disadvantages that exist in the traditional encryption algorithm and decreases the computation time of the inverse matrix so that the comprehensive performance of the algorithm is optimal with different image information.

Driven by a growing awareness for a cleaner environment, a stronger focus on sustainability and intensified environmental regulations, ports are forced to take responsibility when it comes to environmental issues. As a response, in recent studies, the concept of ‘green ports’ emerged. Simultaneously, in the context of digitalisation, the term ‘smart ports’ has received growing attention in the latest scientific discussions, too. Since an important driver towards greener maritime operations is linked to digitalisation, we argue that digital efforts in ports should next to the automation of inherent logistics processes also contribute to reducing the emissions and energy demands. Previous studies have primarily concentrated on the automation of container handling operations. Hence, there exists a research gap concerning the automation of bulk cargo handling operations in ports.

One of the main issues that this integration has brought is an increased vulnerability to a growing number of cyber threats. While several security measures are being implemented to prevent or respond to cyber attacks, the human element is still one of the main weaknesses. Many of today’s cyber attacks take advantage of human personnel’s lack of awareness, which makes cyber security awareness and training activities of critical importance. Unfortunately, current research is still limited in its offerings for cyber security training specific to maritime personnel. Moreover, such training programmes for the professionals should be developed role-based in accordance with the suggestions of many credited maritime organizations. For this reason, we developed a modular cyber security training programme for the maritime domain called Maritime Cyber Security (MarCy) by implementing Critical Events Model (CEM). Then, we evaluated the MarCy programme by utilizing the Delphi technique with the participation of 19 experts from academia and industry. In this study, we offer cyber security training for seafarers and office employees in shipping companies. We proposed eleven elective modules to improve the knowledge, skills, and attitude of learners against cyber risks.

The present paper aims to analyze the key aspects of traditional leadership theories and of military leadership practices, and to further examine their applicability to the modern shipping industry. Towards this end, a systematic literature review in the area of leadership in the armed forces, with emphasis on the navy, and merchant shipping is conducted, whereby challenges and best practices are identified. The literature survey reveals that there are similarities in the role of hierarchy between the navy and merchant shipping. The navy promotes leadership behaviors that diverge from the traditional leader–follower model. Such practices can be useful in the context of commercial shipping in order to inspire leadership behaviors that promote and support the creation of self-efficient and emotionally engaged followers.

This paper proposes a method for automatically selecting maritime traffic stream data for display from a large number of candidates in a context-aware manner. Safety is the most important concern in maritime traffic control, and special care must be taken to avoid collisions between vessels at sea. It presents an architecture for an adaptive information visualization system for a maritime traffic control service. The proposed system adaptively determines the information to be displayed based on the safety evaluation scores and expertise of vessel traffic service operators. It also introduces a method for safety context acquisition to assess the risk of collisions between vessels, using parallel and distributed processing of maritime stream data transmitted by sensors on the vessels at sea. It provides an information-filtering, knowledge extraction method based on the work logs of traffic service operators, using a machine learning technique to generate a decision tree.

This paper focuses on the freight decision-making problem by constructing a multi-round joint-quotation strategy. This paper also demonstrates the potential impact of a joint quotation strategy on the blockchain-based open freight market from a theoretical perspective. The numerical experiment results show that, compared with the initial state, the joint quotation strategy can help to stabilize shipping demands and reduce the fluctuation in overall demands. In this strategy, the freight level needs to be high to maximize profits. However, part of the demands will be sacrificed as a result. Moreover, the optimal equilibrium solution under the joint quotation strategy is relatively vulnerable to changes in the competitive relationship among the members of an alliance. In addition, the joint quotation may also be resolutely resisted by the shipper due to monopoly risk, resulting in a major risk of a sharp reduction in demand. The findings in this paper offer a decision-making reference for the sustainable development of the shipping industry.","https://www.proquest.com/docview/2706455717?accountid=44943&bdid=84593&_bd=F8u%2BYuOqfTHaIULJZU1K7yb8Vtg%3D","https://doi.org/10.3390/su141610441"

The increasing growth of marine applications and services poses challenges for processing marine data, while the resources-limited UAVs cannot satisfy the requirements of computing-intensive and energy consumption. In this paper, we consider a marine edge computing scenario with a group of UAVs and ocean beacon stations (OBSs) and propose a multi-UAV aided multi-access edge computing for marine networks from the perspective of system-welfare and energy-efficient design. Specifically, we propose a multi-task multi-access offloading scheme in marine edge computing networks, in which multiple UAVs can process their workloads locally or offload their partial workloads to multiple OBSs for processing. We consider the total utilities for completing all tasks as the system welfare, and measure the difference between the system welfare and energy consumption as the system revenue. A joint optimization problem is formulated by optimizing the OBS selection, the offloading ratio and the transmission duration, with the objective of increasing the system revenue in marine edge computing networks. We exploit a vertical decomposition architecture to solve the formulated non-convex problem via decomposing it into three sub-problems. Regarding each sub-problem, we propose efficient algorithms to derive the optimal solutions. We finally conduct simulations to verify the performance of the proposed algorithms. The results demonstrate that our proposed algorithms can achieve the best performance for improving the system revenue in comparison with several benchmark algorithms.","https://www.proquest.com/docview/3106490865?accountid=44943&bdid=84593&_bd=IKg44j8mcGCodiaAP1dY46cM7k4%3D","https://doi.org/10.1109/TCOMM.2024.3388501"

This inherent complexity brings huge security challenges, including cargo loss and high burdens in cargo document inspection. The emerging blockchain technology provides a promising tool to build a unified maritime cargo tracking system critical for cargo security. This is because blockchains are a tamper-proof distributed ledger technology that can store and track data in a secure and transparent manner. Using the State of Qatar as a case study, this research introduces the Global Maritime Ledger (GM-Ledger), which will aid authorities in verifying, signing and transacting food certificates in an efficient manner. The methodology of this research includes reviewing past publications, identifying the requirements of various players in the Qatari food import–export industry and then creating a smart contract framework that will efficiently manage the work with necessary human intervention as and when required. The result of this work is the formation of a solid framework that can be employed in future works. This work realized that employing web3 solutions for the food import sector is highly viable and that with the right social, economic and policy reforms, it is possible to transform the entire food system to bear healthy transparency and power balance in global supply chains.

USVs can work as edge computing devices to locally and cooperatively perform heavy computational tasks without dependence of remote cloud servers. As such, we organize a team of USVs to escort a high value ship (e.g., mother ship) in a complex maritime environment with hostile intruder ships, where the significant challenge is to learn cooperation of USVs and assign each USV tasks to achieve optimal performance. To this end, in this paper, a hierarchical scheme is proposed for the USV team to guard a valuable ship, which belongs to problems of sparse rewards and long-time horizons in multi-agent reinforcement learning. The core idea utilized in the proposed scheme is centralized training with decentralized execution, where USVs learn policies to guard a high-value ship with extra shared environmental data from other USVs through communication. Specifically, the ships are divided into two groups, i.e., high-level ship and low-level USVs. The high-level ship optimizes decision-level policy to predict intercept points, while each low-level USV utilizes multi-agent reinforcement learning to learn task-level policy to intercept intruders. The hierarchical task guidance is exploited in maritime escorting, whereby high-level ship’s decision-level policy guides the training and execution of task-level policies of USVs. Simulation results and experiment analysis show that the proposed hierarchical scheme can efficiently execute the escort mission.","https://www.proquest.com/docview/2436975423?accountid=44943&bdid=84593&_bd=TXFn5Nd%2B7EV48kOM35zYhaiJRvw%3D","https://doi.org/10.1007/s12083-019-00857-6"

Maritime transportation plays an increasingly essential part in the global supply network. Since maritime shipping services need to exchange a huge number of papers and paperwork across numerous companies, the usage of a unified platform for inter-organisational communication and information sharing is required. To develop an integrative, adaptive, and intelligent container booking system, a multi-agent architecture is designed in this article. The proposed architecture will aid the maritime industry in establishing real-time information interchange between autonomous agents, shippers, freight forwarders, and shipping lines. The process outlined in this paper reveals how the agents communicate with one another to resolve underlying inconsistencies. With the multi-agent framework, the article also presents a container slot optimisation problem considering market segmentation, different booking periods, heterogeneous containers and port congestion scenarios. Using this model the managers can find the booking limit for each type of containers and accordingly they can accept or reject the incoming booking requests. Furthermore, a simulated case study is also provided to validate the model.","https://www.proquest.com/docview/2954109475?accountid=44943&bdid=84593&_bd=6NJojId8VONDcOPVEh1SoFfN02A%3D","https://doi.org/10.1080/00207543.2022.2065550"

However, with a large distance to the search areas, the sea transition (from one point to the other) of the underwater vehicles requires high energy costs. This leads to the necessity to use heavy-duty underwater vehicles, which determines the high cost of the search operation. The transport of underwater vehicles is proposed to be carried out with an unmanned surface vessel, equipped with actuators for the automatic release of a group of vehicles under water and receiving on board after the end of the underwater mission. The maritime unmanned complex consisting of an unmanned surface vessel and a group of autonomous underwater vehicles on its board forms a new type of marine robotics, the complete automation of which is an actual scientific and technical task. For its implementation, the underlying (basic) automation technology of the marine search underwater mission has been developed as the theoretical basis for the development of the generalized structure of the complex automatic control system. Ten implementation stages of the underlying technology are formulated and the analysis of their automation features with the use of modern methods in the field of marine robotics is performed. Automation of the underlying technology stages involves the transfer of the vessel to a given water area, the automatic release (launch) of the group of underwater vehicles and their coordinated motion to the search area, the search operations and the return to the unmanned surface vessel, as well as the recovery of the vessel to the base. The generalized requirements for automatic control systems constituting the maritime unmanned complex at each stage of its functioning are provided. The spiral trajectory of waiting for the motion of the underwater vehicles at the group formation stages, for the search operation execution and after its completion, is proposed. For the spatial motion of the autonomous underwater vehicle as an agent of the group, the automatic control system was improved by introducing the blocks of the “Navigation Situation Model” and the “Navigation Threat Identifier, which make it impossible for emergency collision with the neighboring underwater vehicles of the group and disintegrate the group due to the data communication loss between them.","https://www.proquest.com/docview/2604138934?accountid=44943&bdid=84593&_bd=OsSb%2FovpP0dwJ4VtUd9P8KvKgvM%3D","https://doi.org/10.21303/2461-4262.2019.00940"

However, the interchange of data in such an environment poses major challenges, such as a low bandwidth and the unreliability of the environment where transmissions take place. Furthermore, the relevant information that must be sent, as well as the exact size that will allow understanding it, is usually not clearly established, as standardization works are scarce in this domain. Under these conditions, establishing a way to interchange information at the data level among autonomous maritime vehicles becomes of critical importance since the needed information, along with the size of the transferred data, will have to be defined.

First established in 1978, the STCW convention standardized educational procedures for seafarers. Since then, it has become the most influential regulatory document for maritime education. The STCW code had major revisions in 1995 and 2010. These amendments were in response to the recognized need to bring the Convention up to date. However, it has been over a decade since the latest amendments came into force, and over the past decade, new educational technologies and digital educational methods have developed significantly. Not only that, but technologies used onboard ships have also advanced considerably. Today, digitalization and the fourth industrial revolution are rapidly reshaping the maritime industry, as well as maritime education. These issues coupled with the disruption caused by the Covid pandemic increased the need for more advanced training tools and methods in MET. Concerns are rising regarding the need for more comprehensive rules that will better reflect today's educational needs and progress in the literature. This paper takes a first step toward addressing these issues by improving the understanding of the currently used advanced teaching methods in MET. This bibliometric review provides developments in the field from the perspective of educators and researchers. As a result, we discovered several narratives and literature gaps in MET. This article reviews the currently investigated subjects and topics, used educational tools and equipment, types of research, and main influencers in MET research. The field is still newly developing, but at a rapid pace. Newly developed tools and methods are increasing, but advances are also constrained because they are made to fit the decade‐old regulations.","https://www.proquest.com/docview/2915037659?accountid=44943&bdid=84593&_bd=3CE5VwwPdHTDsxXj6ePqvPN%2BJzE%3D","https://doi.org/10.1002/cae.22690"

Their positive impact on the supply chain is enabling processes to be optimized through smarter production. In the case of Spain, the Spanish public entity Puertos del Estado (Puertos del Estado is a public business entity dependent on the Spanish Ministry of Transport, Mobility and the Urban Agenda, with overall responsibility for the entire state-owned port system.) has launched Ports 4.0, the largest open innovation fund for the logistics-port ecosystem. It is therefore necessary to know the point of digitalization in which the Spanish ports are and the present scenario in which they develop their activity. For this purpose, a SWOT analysis (Strengths-Weaknesses-Opportunities-Threats analysis) is proposed, which is an ideal tool to make a reliable diagnosis of the port system in relation to a certain project before which we wish to make a strategic decision, in this case digitalization, in order to establish a concrete action plan in this regard. This should be the first step towards developing the Ports 4.0 project. The main conclusion of the analysis is that Spanish ports are currently at a medium high level of digitalization, and that they continue to update and innovate in order to be increasingly competitive in this market, despite the fact that there is still a long way to go in digitalization. The main challenge for Spanish ports is that technology alone is not useful enough to reach Ports 4.0 status; the technology also needs to be used in an integrated, open and joint way by all the agents of the port community, which is one of the main handicaps at present.","https://www.proquest.com/docview/2440755038?accountid=44943&bdid=84593&_bd=1a4rbZJT7ttMUv1Way8uwdzvDcg%3D","https://doi.org/10.3390/logistics4030020"

Formal regulations suggest using manual inspection of the ship rotation and the work effectiveness of the engine during manoeuvring in ports and in the open sea regions. The accuracy of this procedure is very low and depends on the personnel of the deck. Therefore, automation and computer control systems are constantly required to assist the human eye. This problem becomes clearly visible when dealing with full ship autonomy in the open sea in the short-sea shipping regions. The trend of maritime technology development will only increase in the area of human interaction decrease with the physical operations and the shipping procedures, which will lead to the future full ship autonomy in the open sea regions around the globe. With the growing automation technologies, predictive control can prove to be a better approach than the traditionally applied visual inspection policy and linear control models. Ship full autonomy is also linked to the ship’s machinery regular repair and maintenance that has to be carried out for delivering satisfactory performance and minimizing downtime during transportation operations. In this paper, current stages of development of the intelligent transportation system concept are discussed for the ship autonomy in manoeuvring control and a robust ships’ systems integration and communication system concept is presented for several normal and abnormal situations: high-traffic, potentially dangerous situations or port approaching or ship maintenance, with the capability to solve problems with the limited human interface and with a remote control possibility. Then, simplified ship steering motor system for the main pump is analysed for rotation control using control voltage from the converters.

To improve the accuracy of emission estimates, this study proposed a machine learning-based classification model for identifying operational phases. We proposed 12 operational phase relevance features by analyzing motion behavior-related and geospatial characteristics-related features from the Automatic Identification System (AIS) data from the two bulk carriers. The random forest (RF) model showed the best performance in identifying one of the bulk carrier’s operational phases among the five machine models, with the accuracy, F1score and Area Under Curve (AUC) of 96.66%, 93.34% and 99.93%, respectively. By adopting the Progressive Ablation Feature Selection (PAFS) method with RF, the number of features was reduced from 12 to 8, and the accuracy (96.38%), F1score (92.70%), and AUC (98.81%) were almost same with that obtained from all 12 features. Additionally, the effectiveness of the RF model was validated on the other bulk carriers. Compared with the traditional algorithms, the RF model showed better performance in ship operational phase identification and improved the average accuracy of NOx emission estimation for the main engine and auxiliary engine by 57.83% and 93.89%, respectively, under different operational phases. These results provide the basis for port traffic management and ship emission control.Implications: A new ship operational phase identification approach was proposed in this study. If the proposed approach is adopted by International Maritime Organization, it will improve the accuracy of ship emission estimates and bring new insights into global shipping greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and their impact on global change. The port authorities could benefit from the proposed approach, which can be extended to ship types with similar behavior to bulk carriers, such as containers and general cargoes. This can reveal patterns of ship behavior in specific areas, which helps to identify potential collision risks, channel blockages, and other safety issues and take appropriate management measures to ensure the safe operation of the port. The proposed approach can help shipping companies to accurately estimate the GHG emissions of their fleets and to accurately predict carbon tax costs. Base on that, carbon emissions and carbon tax burden can be reduced by adopting corresponding management control measures.","https://www.proquest.com/docview/2919992528?accountid=44943&bdid=84593&_bd=d374asvYuEb4SMDDleBYkgaGgXc%3D","https://doi.org/10.1080/10962247.2023.2274348"

Accordingly, the CSFs identified were ‘stakeholder expectations’, ‘organisational competency’, ‘technology acceptance’, and ‘individual motivation’. A survey was then crafted and handed out to major container lines. The fuzzy analytic hierarchy process (FAHP) was then conducted to analyse the collected data. The results show that organisational competency is the most important CSF, followed by technology acceptance, stakeholders’ expectations, and individual motivation. The top three sub-CSFs are financial stability, regulatory bodies’ expectations, and digital readiness.

The complete IoT OTH maritime surveillance network is currently deployed in the Gulf of Guinea, which due to its tropical climate represents an unfavorable environment for sensors and communications. In this paper, we have examined the service performance under various meteorological conditions specific to the Gulf of Guinea. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first analysis of IoT OTH maritime surveillance service in equatorial environment. Our analysis aims to mathematically describe the impact of harsh weather conditions on the performance of the service in order to mitigate it with careful overall system design and provide constant quality of the service. Analyses presented in the paper show that average service latency is about 90 s, but it can rise to about 120 s, which is used as a key information during the sensor data fusion algorithm design. Validity of the analyses is demonstrated through high quality of service with an outage probability of just 0.1% in the driest months up to the 0.7% in the rainiest months. The work presented here can be used as a guideline for deployment of maritime surveillance service solutions in other equatorial regions. Moreover, the gained experience presented in this paper will significantly facilitate future expansions of the existing maritime surveillance network with more HFSWRs.

However, due to task heterogeneity and the limited computing power of individual vessels or stakeholders, although third-party clouds could provide powerful computing support for MTS, directly aggregating data from vessels to the cloud may cause privacy leakage and security concerns. Crowdsourcing as a newly distributed problem-solving paradigm could provide new solutions for conducting maritime big data computing, deep learning and sensing tasks by leveraging the crowd intelligence and computing power of vessels, but strong incentives are required to stimulate vessels to participate because of their selfishness and rationality. Nevertheless, existing incentives rarely consider the security problems caused by the man-in-the-middle attacks, honest-but-curious platform attacks and inference attacks simultaneously, and ignore the redundant winners and multi-attribute characteristics of participants. Toward this end, this paper proposes a tensor-based secure truthful incentive for IoT-MTS dubbed CrowdTensor to maximize the social welfare by eliminating redundant winners and meanwhile guaranteeing the desired economic properties, where the multi-attribute features and the complex association relationships of crowdsourcing systems are characterized by utilizing the tensor tool. A two-phase bid-preserving mechanism based on the cryptographic hash function and digital signature is introduced against malicious attacks. Both the rigorous theoretical analysis and extensive experimental results show that CrowdTensor outperforms other compared incentives and the desired properties can be achieved simultaneously.","https://www.proquest.com/docview/3055167373?accountid=44943&bdid=84593&_bd=sYKeipxefZEGRy3DRR5fXGpjSOQ%3D","https://doi.org/10.1109/TITS.2023.3300892"

Hence, the purpose of this study the development and evaluation of ports play a key role in their commercial success. Development policies can be formulated for these ports by properly evaluating their performance indicators. On the other hand, traditional methods of performance evaluation cannot provide a good multidimensional evaluation of the status of ports.Design/methodology/approach>More than 90% of the world’s heavy transit today is carried out by the sea. With this volume of freight, transit accidents are inevitable for ships passing through oceans, seas, waterways, rivers, ports and mooring at docks. Besides, gases from ships’ fuels at sea, especially in ports, oil spills due to maritime incidents, the negligence of the ship’s crew, the use of port equipment, dirty fuel of diesel power substations, etc., have increased greenhouse gases, polluted the environment and endangered human lives.Findings>A new approach has been introduced in the field of port performance evaluation based on the components of greenness and intelligence. This approach performs evaluations in two stages and a network. In this study, the performance of 11 Iranian ports was evaluated based on the network data envelopment analysis approach in 2 stages of greenness and intelligence during 4 years. The results indicated that only 5% of the ports meet the standards of intelligence and greenness.Originality/value>On the other hand, as shown in the above studies, the issue of green ports is directly related to the development of animal and plant ecosystems in the seas and the environment around ports. The presence of pollution in the ports has caused the animal and plant habitats around the ports to face a complete pollution crisis or to be completely destroyed. Therefore, the development of green port concepts in third world countries will help prevent environmental pollution of the seas. Therefore, it is necessary for ports to review their strategic maritime transport model and use the development of green port indicators in their implementation processes. Therefore, the strategic development of green ports is created to create and benefit from the components of intelligence, and as mentioned in previous research, intelligence and greenness are in line and the lack of development of one of the concepts causes defects in others. According to reports provided in Iran’s maritime transport systems, most accidents have led to environmental disasters during the absence of intelligent equipment. The use of smart technologies prevents all environmental damage and the development of port services. On the other hand, in evaluating the published articles in the field of development of green and smart ports, so far, the components of intelligence and greenness have not been evaluated and analyzed in a practical and operational way in ports and only the influencing the development of agents on each other has been done (Chen, 2019). Therefore, evaluating the efficiency of ports based on green components and intelligence causes ports to fundamentally review their executive infrastructure and take an active part in the global green development plan.","https://www.proquest.com/docview/2703444177?accountid=44943&bdid=84593&_bd=UAzv7DF2whMGRhi3EXBGCh3E8F4%3D","https://doi.org/10.1108/JM2-03-2021-0071"

However, new cybercrime threats have emerged affecting, both ship safety and security that need to be assessed and evaluated. At the moment, actions of the maritime industry to keep pace dealing with such threats are slow when compared with other business sectors. As a high concern, maritime pirates could take advantage of cybersecurity breaches to monitor ship activity and gain information for potential protective failures. In 2021 companies and seafarers should be able to demonstrate knowledge and safeguard policies of their companies. Nevertheless, there is limited discussion on how companies will educate seafarers for existing threats. Therefore, in this study, a risk-based methodology is proposed for evaluation of cybersecurity threats in the context of a piracy attack. STPA-SafeSec’s analysis is used to identify security threats, and FAHP is utilised for evaluating the severity of each security constraint. Audits on 15 ships with 315 seafarers indicated that there are significant security gaps mainly due to lack of awareness from operators and seafarers. However, physical security and network protection that already apply to ships are significant security strengths.","https://www.proquest.com/docview/2473315475?accountid=44943&bdid=84593&_bd=EHiRxSjoZXvunJnt3B4tnC6%2FlS4%3D","https://doi.org/10.1007/s12198-020-00223-1"

Unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) is able to alleviate the computing pressure of MDs by forwarding the computing tasks to the edge server on the coast. However, UAV relaying introduces a significant security challenge due to the vulnerability of line-of-sight (LoS) communication channels, which can be exploited for eavesdropping on computing tasks. In this paper, an efficient secure communication scheme is proposed for UAV-relay-assisted maritime mobile edge computing (MEC) with a flying eavesdropper. The secure computing capacity of MDs is maximized by jointly optimizing the transmit power, time slot allocation factor, computation optimization and UAV trajectory. Due to multi-variable coupling, the formulated optimization problem (OP) is non-convex. We first transform OP by introducing auxiliary variables. Then, the transformed OP is decomposed and solved in an iterative manner by applying block coordinate descent (BCD) and successive convex approximation (SCA). Numerical results show that the secure computing capability of the UAV-relay-assisted maritime MEC system of proposed secure communication scheme can be effectively improved compared with benchmarks.","https://www.proquest.com/docview/2969044582?accountid=44943&bdid=84593&_bd=GBslT40TrjAYTcH7KK9g3Akgl1A%3D","https://doi.org/10.1109/TCOMM.2023.3330884"

During our research, we analyzed four and a half years of database and machine stock of 3 food companies. We have found that companies in this industry prefer process-based production. It is important that manufacturing companies pay close attention to the proper design of automation, the purpose of which is to acquire and maintain a competitive advantage through the efficient, rapid manufacture of products. The expansion of industrial robots has increased considerably (Figure 4.), increasing the productivity, accuracy and flexibility of manufacturing processes, and has enabled a number of business processes to be re-established and new business models brought to life.Methods: The two best time-oriented methods, the PERT and CPM analysis, were used to assess the individual stages of the production, which made estimates for the duration of the activities. When drawing the box graph, we extracted outlying data from the data set, so we obtained a more accurate statistical estimate. Using this, we made a recommendation for the expected completion of workflows, which is more accurate in determining delivery dates for sales orders. Analyzing the four-and-a-half year dataset, we determined, by using Student's t-test, that the average of the sample elements in reality is different from the estimates we made. The PERT and CPM methods have proven themselves in the past decades and continue to be of great value. The ever-changing business world and the high cost have an impact on the economy.Results: The production times of individual companies are influenced by the use of more modern machines and well-developed manufacturing plans and schedules. Using PERT and CPM methods, we've helped to better define production time, making it easier to calculate delivery dates correctly. Automation does not stop all occupations, but only triggers certain activities and redefines jobs. There is no doubt that the technological development of manufacturing processes will change the organization of the industries concerned and affect the geographic location of each activity. There is a serious chance that the production of these products will go elsewhere to save on shipping costs.Conclusions: During our analysis, we have found that new technologies have an impact on productivity, employment and the transformation of the geographic structure of value-added activities, that’s why their role is important both for food companies and companies operating in other industries. Automation is made possible by scientific achievements and technological advances that are used to develop industry 4.0 technologies. The huge amount of data produced in the Intelligent Production Systems (Big Data) analysis and on this basis, the continuous modification of production systems, results in significant material and labor saving, efficiency gains and productivity gains, which have an impact on employment and the transformation of geographic structures.  Food processing and delivery to consumers is a key factor in the security of food supply, and therefore has an essential importance in the further development of the sector.","https://www.proquest.com/docview/2072335096?accountid=44943&bdid=84593&_bd=SzpNvx1cBGZSTzderF9FixV2yE0%3D","https://doi.org/10.17270/J.LOG.2018.290"

Moving to cloud brings some benefits: create new applications, store large sets of data, process large amount of data. Individual users or companies can store own data on cloud (e.g. maritime, environmental protection, physics analysis etc.). An important thing before storing in cloud is that data needs to be encrypted, in order to keep its confidentiality. Among these, users can store encrypted documents on cloud. However, when owner needs a specific document, they should retrieve all documents from cloud, decrypt them, chose the desired document, encrypt again and finally store back encrypted documents on cloud. To avoid these entire steps, a user can choose to work with searchable encryption. This is an encryption technique, where key words (or indexes) are associated to encrypted documents, and when the owner needs a document, he/she only needs to search throw key words and then retrieve the documents that have associated the desired keywords. An important programming paradigm for cloud computing is MapReduce, which allows high scalability on a large number of servers in a cluster. Basically, MapReduce works with (key, value) pairs.

Automation produced a contraction of the number of dockworkers since the 1960s. However, the idea that technological innovation will produce the disappearance of work is not sustained by empirical evidence. For this reason, trade unions have been particularly watchful. Despite the discourses about robotization carried out by supply chain operators, the paradigm of the post-COVID logistics chain is still based upon the human labor cost. During the pandemic there has been a transformation in working conditions not in terms of replacing people with robots, but rather of the robotization of workers to obtain the maximum productive exploitation at the minimum wage allowed. The purpose of this article is to provide an analysis of labor relations and workers organizing in light of the automation processes in the European port of Antwerp. The article focuses on how working conditions and jobs are potentially impacted by automation in ports, and on how workers disruptive strategies are resisting to these dynamics.

The most important and dangerous ones at the same time are the threats with impact on security and safety. At sea, more than in other fields, these threats are very different, starting with piracy, armed robbery and taking hostages up to different forms of terrorist or cybercrime acts. Piracy and other violent activities appear specifically in particular geographical areas, mostly based on different conflicts inside seaside countries. For the other threats considered, such as different types of terrorist activities, there are not geographical areas of interest defined. They can appear all over the world. The terrorist acts in the maritime field are not necessarily to be treated as a direct action, background systems may also be used, like information or operative computer control systems, which have a great importance and impact on the proper functionality of the maritime systems. Nowadays, there are some serious cybersecurity incidents with major impact on a worldwide scale. In the last decade there was a limited approach to address such major issues, most of them based on several methods, which had a centralized point of failure: the lack of knowledge and adaptability versus new ways of system penetration. For the technical vulnerabilities there are different solutions already developed, or being developed, for data protection and information security. Despite some important developments on data security, many of the important sectors remain under high risk regarding cybersecurity. The maritime sector today is considered one of the most exposed sectors to cyber threats, due to the global nature of the business as well as a great economical, geopolitical and environmental influence. Here, the higher vulnerability remains the human element, as an operative part of the data systems. Humans will always be a source for mistakes and errors. “To err is human” can be successfully applied in many activity fields, included the maritime one. The main purpose of any study on these matters, human factor and cyber protection is to start from the unpredictability of the human behaviour. It would be almost impossible to provide a totally secure information system, as long as such a system is exposed to the human factor. This paper intends to analyse possible models of human behaviour with impact on data systems’ protection in the maritime field and how systems can be improved and highly secured for any vulnerabilities based on these models.","https://www.proquest.com/docview/2300712937?accountid=44943&bdid=84593&_bd=3dN5g%2F8MylZaxay59F%2BfghREzZc%3D","https://doi.org/10.4028/www.scientific.net/AEF.34.267"

The design of supply chains that deliver these fuels needs to consider quality variability with special attention to shipping costs, because biofuel feedstocks are voluminous. Stochastic programming models that consider all these considerations incur a heavy computational burden. The present work proposes a hybrid strategy that leverages machine learning to reduce the computational complexity of stochastic programming models via problem space reduction. First, numerous randomly generated reduced-space versions of the problem are solved multiple times to generate a set of solution data based on the concept of bootstrapping. Next, a supervised machine learning algorithm is implemented to predict a potentially beneficial mixed integer linear program problem space from which a near-optimal solution can be obtained. Finally, the mixed integer linear program selects the optimal solution from the reduced space generated by the machine learning algorithm. Through extensive numerical experimentation, we determine how much the problem space can be reduced, how many times the reduced space problem needs to be solved and the best performing machine learning techniques for this application. Several supervised learning algorithms, including logistic regression, decision tree, random forest, support vector machine, and k-nearest neighbors, are evaluated. The numerical experiments demonstrate that our proposed solution procedure yields near-optimal outcomes with a considerably reduced computational burden.","https://www.proquest.com/docview/2948052323?accountid=44943&bdid=84593&_bd=9QHo3Q%2FKm2r6PZMl9BsErke4BIU%3D","https://doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2024.3372516"
"Preparation of a Smart Port Indicator and Calculation of a Ranking for the Spanish Port System","","Alberto Rodrigo González; González-Cancelas, Nicoletta; Beatriz Molina Serrano; Alberto Camarero Orive","Logistics","Scholarly Journals","","4","2","2020-01-01","2020","9","","","23056290","","","ENG","Nowadays, the denomination of “smart” is associated with several production and management devices and to logistics and distribution, too. Thus, this qualification is used in different application fields. All of them are different and diverse, but the most important common characteristics of these devices or Smart Systems are based on their novel and more efficient way of working. The smart trend is consolidated in the port environment, too. The ports’ need to become more intelligent is modifying their own operations. Therefore, this paper includes an analysis of Spanish Port System, in order to evaluate its ports, considering the new concept called “Smart Port”. Some indicators and measure variables are defined, to allow for quantifying technical items. These items—both quantitative and qualitative ones—which reflect, in the most objective and complete way possible, the adaptation and achievement of characteristics and objectives associated with the Smart Port concept in all ports were studied, in order to obtain an index of Smart Ports that allows us to calculate the ranking of the Spanish Smart Ports. Considering the analysis of the Smart Port concept and its current and future trends, it has been determined that the development of a port must be based on the digitalization, on use of ICT and on automation of port processes.","https://www.proquest.com/docview/2398969503?accountid=44943&bdid=84593&_bd=Pg7D1QLKIcTLPmP8FGmguTFzxRE%3D","https://doi.org/10.3390/logistics4020009"

Despite the commercial benefits to the region, there are certain issues related to the preservation of the local ecosystem and safety. This danger is further deteriorated by the absence of regulations on allowed waterways. Marine accidents could cause a major ecological disaster in the area and pose big socio-economic impacts in Greece. Monitoring marine traffic data is of major importance and one of the primary goals of the current research. Real-time monitoring and alerting can be extremely useful to local authorities, companies, NGO’s and the public in general. Apart from real-time applications, the knowledge discovery from historical data is also significant. Towards this direction, a data analysis and simulation framework for maritime data has been designed and developed. The framework analyzes historical data about ships and area conditions, of varying time and space granularity, measures critical parameters that could influence the levels of hazard in certain regions and clusters such data according to their similarity. Upon this unsupervised step, the degree of hazard is estimated and along with other important parameters is fed into a special type of Bayesian network, in order to infer on future situations, thus, simulating future data based on past conditions. Another innovative aspect of this work is the modeling of shipping traffic as a social network, whose analysis could provide useful and informative visualizations. The use of such a system is particularly beneficial for multiple stakeholders, such as the port authorities, the ministry of Mercantile Marine, etc. mainly due to the fact that specific policy options can be evaluated and re-designed based on feedback from our framework.","https://www.proquest.com/docview/2545911936?accountid=44943&bdid=84593&_bd=rn5A%2BizBSwAUFgHA%2BYaa%2BqUQAtM%3D","https://doi.org/10.3390/a12010027"

The empirical analysis relies on a survey-based approach and the input of senior representatives of terminal operating entities in charge of the fully and semi-automated container terminals. The analysis of the findings, using statistical tools (i.e., descriptive statistics, Pearson correlations, ANOVA, Kruskal-Wallis), reveals that most of the benefits assumed by an individual terminal operator materialized once the automated terminal was in operation. It also concludes that expectations often exceed benefits and vice versa.

This inherent complexity brings huge security challenges, including cargo loss and high burdens in cargo document inspection. The emerging blockchain technology provides a promising tool to build a unified maritime cargo tracking system critical for cargo security. This is because blockchains are a tamper-proof distributed ledger technology that can store and track data in a secure and transparent manner. Using the State of Qatar as a case study, this research introduces the Global Maritime Ledger (GM-Ledger), which will aid authorities in verifying, signing and transacting food certificates in an efficient manner. The methodology of this research includes reviewing past publications, identifying the requirements of various players in the Qatari food import-export industry and then creating a smart contract framework that will efficiently manage the work with necessary human intervention as and when required. The result of this work is the formation of a solid framework that can be employed in future works. This work realized that employing web3 solutions for the food import sector is highly viable and that with the right social, economic and policy reforms, it is possible to transform the entire food system to bear healthy transparency and power balance in global supply chains.

To further improve the efficiency of maritime data transmission between the UAVs and the maritime buoys, optical communication is considered as a promising technique because of its low latency and high bandwidth. However, optical communication encounters the challenge of beam pointing alignment, particularly in maritime data transmission involving wave disturbance and drift of buoy, which deteriorates and even interrupts the line-of-sight (LOS) optical transmission. To tackle the challenge, this article proposes DERLOC, a reliable data transmission solution based on deep reinforcement learning (DRL). We first provide the optimization analysis of reliable data transmission and formulate the data transmission procedure as a Markov decision process (MDP) aiming at maximizing the received signal intensity. Afterwards, we propose a beam pointing adjustment algorithm based on the soft actor-critic (SAC) approach to alleviate the performance deterioration caused by waves. Then, we analyze the drift characteristic of a buoy and develop a method which enables UAV to predict the position and determine an optimal movement control strategy for ensuring the effectiveness of beam pointing and maintaining stable LOS communication. Through extensive simulations and real-time data validation, the results demonstrate that DERLOC is effective and enables a reliable data transmission via optical links.","https://www.proquest.com/docview/3053296703?accountid=44943&bdid=84593&_bd=W0ELNjZP4SygNIbP8eCT1mJDbJs%3D","https://doi.org/10.1109/JIOT.2024.3365863"

However, automatic computation and data recognition may invite several security and privacy threats into the system during the sharing of information. There exist several intrusion detection systems (IDS) that have been proposed by several researchers. However, none of them is able to maintain accuracy while identifying the threats and give a high false-positive rate in the network. Further, the existing IDS are not able to recognize the new patterns or anomalies in the network. Therefore, it is necessary to propose a new IDS. The aim of this paper is to propose an IDS using the Viterbi algorithm, indirect trust, and blockchain mechanism for IIoT to ensure the required security levels. The Viterbi algorithm and indirect trust mechanism are used to measure the probability of malicious activities occurring in the network while generating, recording, and shipping products in an IIoT environment. Further, the transparency of the system is maintained by integrating blockchain mechanisms with Viterbi and indirect methods. The proposed framework is validated and analyzed against various security measures by comparing it with the existing approaches.","https://www.proquest.com/docview/2756736382?accountid=44943&bdid=84593&_bd=6WATeFnCAVZAznywo6WKO2C2RcY%3D","https://doi.org/10.3390/jsan11040071"

In the context of maritime operations, varying consequences of automation malfunction on human performance can be observed. This study introduced a two‐step research framework to examine the repercussions of such malfunctions, particularly those related to communication and coordination among human teams in ship engine rooms. Initially, a qualitative semi‐structured interview was conducted with seven professional marine engineers to explore the potential impact of hypothetical automation malfunction on team communication. Subsequently, a quantitative survey involving 32 professional marine engineers employed coordination demand analysis (CDA) to scrutinize changes in team coordination resulting from malfunction. The findings indicate that an automation malfunction within an engine room can precipitate an abrupt overload of the socio‐technical system. This can significantly increase communication frequency among engineers, particularly in relation to the physical and organizational aspects of the environment. Furthermore, the study highlights the influence of disparate levels of expertise among team members on coordination demands. A positive correlation was discovered between differences in expertise and increased coordination demands within a team. These insights underscore the necessity for future research on human–automation interaction, specifically focusing on individual differences and nontechnical skills.","https://www.proquest.com/docview/3052332494?accountid=44943&bdid=84593&_bd=sbTfGBkFes1nN0Xer8SRGVC%2FcEQ%3D","https://doi.org/10.1002/prs.12571"

The aim of this work is to demonstrate the prediction accuracy of various machine learning (ML) algorithms for a free-space optical communication (FSO) link performance, with respect to real time, non-linear atmospheric conditions. A large data set of received signal strength indicators (RSSI) for a laser communications link has been collected and analyzed against seven local atmospheric parameters (i.e., wind speed, pressure, temperature, humidity, dew point, solar flux and air-sea temperature difference). The k-nearest-neighbors (KNN), tree-based methods-decision trees, random forest and gradient boosting- and artificial neural networks (ANN) have been employed and compared among each other using the root mean square error (RMSE) and the coefficient of determination (R2) of each model as the primary performance indices. The regression analysis revealed an excellent fit for all ML models, indicative of their ability to offer a significant improvement in FSO performance modeling as compared to traditional regression models.

Autonomous shipping is frequently claimed to reduce human error, whereas in reality, any issue connected to humans will arguably move with the people from ship to shore in that different people will make different mistakes; with possibly more severe consequences. Furthermore, autonomous shipping is likely to require changes to regulation and increased attention to cyber security and other IT human-centred quality factors if it is to succeed. What the HUMANE project is interested in is how (in certain scenarios) the human collaborates with, hands over to, or takes over from the technology/automation to achieve an overall safe state of the system. The aim is to map and investigate a potential gap between current human skills, training and education and an autonomous maritime future, and to provide insight to enable mitigating change. The main project method is expert workshops, performed in a focus group style. Four workshops are planned and to date (mid 2019), two have been performed. The topic of the first was technology, and the second was legal, class and insurance implications. For this paper, we have analysed the data relevant to future skills.

Artificial intelligence (AI) is expected to be partially responsible for navigation; nevertheless, the importance of human intervention is higher than ever. Human intervention in the control of an autonomous ship via the remote operator requires navigation proficiency. The education method for the remote operators that is presently considered is simulation training. However, the simulation training does not take long enough time for enabling trainees to develop their navigation proficiency equivalent to that of conventional ships navigators. In addition, the simulation training should contain various navigation scenarios to train the trainee properly. Therefore, this paper suggests the methods to generate the massive and practical navigation scenarios by extracting navigation elements’ distribution from actual ship trajectory data and applying them to the permutation of navigation elements. The results demonstrated the advantages of the proposed methods by comparing the sample navigation scenario and an example of an impractical navigation scenario. In conclusion, it is expected that the massive generation of practical navigation scenarios using the proposed permutation model will positively affect the simulation training of the maritime autonomous surface ship remote operators.","https://www.proquest.com/docview/2636122414?accountid=44943&bdid=84593&_bd=luKeWKg1hIhvSskLOZJTap16TTY%3D","https://doi.org/10.3390/app12031651"

One current application is that providing supply chain transparency, sellers can disclose product information to consumers for authentication and certification. To examine the supply chain blockchain based transparency‐level strategy and its interact with different refund policies, in a two‐echelon supply chain, we consider a supplier decides on the transparency level and wholesale price, and a retailer decides on retail price and provides full refund (policy F), or partial refund (policy P), or no refund (policy N) policy to consumers. We find the refund policy choice and the transparency‐level strategy have a mutual influence. A lenient refund policy (a higher refund) can generate more demand, which makes the supplier to provide a high transparency level, whereas a high consumer's transparency awareness also promotes the retailer to choose a more lenient refund policy. We find Pareto improvement exists under a cost‐sharing strategy, and the retailer is willing to share part of the adoption cost only when the efficiency of improving the transparency level is moderate. Otherwise, the retailer adopts blockchain technology only when there is no cost sharing. Further, different shipping cost bearers can change the sensitivity of refund policy choice, and the supplier prefers to provide a high transparency level when the retailer covers the shipping cost. When the retailer becomes more socially responsible, the supplier is more willing to provide a higher transparency level, and the retailer is more willing to provide a partial refund policy.","https://www.proquest.com/docview/3069552975?accountid=44943&bdid=84593&_bd=QAePGCAUl3c5DsnD6PFTs59l28k%3D","https://doi.org/10.1111/itor.13303"

To build a resilient and sustainable supply chain, industrial practitioners are eager to systematically revamp the freight management decision process related to the selection of carriers, shipping lanes, and third-party logistics service providers. Therefore, this study aims at strengthening decision-making capabilities for global freight management, in which an industrial blockchain-based global freight decision framework (IB-GFDF) is proposed to incorporate consortium blockchain technology with the Bayesian best-worst method. Through the blockchain technology, pairwise comparisons can be conducted over the international freight network in a decentralized and immutable manner, and thus, a secure and commonly agreed-on pairwise comparison dataset is acquired. Subsequently, the pairwise comparison dataset with multi-stakeholder opinions is analyzed using the Bayesian best-worst method in order to prioritize the selection decision criteria related to carriers, shipping lanes, and 3PL service providers for global freight management. To verify the methodological feasibility, a case study of an Australian agricultural supply chain firm was conducted to support the development end-to-end (E2E) supply chain solutions originated from Australia. It was found that port infrastructure, ports of call and communication effectiveness were the major criteria for the selection decision, which can be emphasized in future global freight collaboration.

It is thus necessary to restore the visually degraded images and to guarantee maritime transportation efficiency and safety under hazy imaging conditions. In this work, a contrastive learning framework is proposed for haze visibility enhancement in intelligent maritime transportation systems. In particular, the proposed learning method could fully learn both local and global image features, which are beneficial for visual quality improvement. A total of 100 clean images containing water traffic scenes were selected as the synthetic test dataset, and good dehazing results were achieved on both visual and indexing results (e.g., peak signal to noise ratio (PSNR): 23.95±3.48and structural similarity index (SSIM): 0.924±0.065for different transmittance and atmospheric light values). In addition, extensive experiments on real-world 100 water hazy images demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method (e.g., natural image quality evaluator (NIQE): 4.800±0.634and perception-based image quality evaluator (PIQE): 46.320±10.253). The enhanced images could be effectively exploited for promoting the accuracy and robustness of ship detection. The maritime traffic supervision and management could be accordingly improved in the intelligent transportation system.","https://www.proquest.com/docview/2722975020?accountid=44943&bdid=84593&_bd=hejGb991KnGkZyv7Oz8X2luyT4Q%3D","https://doi.org/10.1155/2022/2160044"

Charlotte (North Carolina), ISSN 0749-0208.Airborne Bathymetric LiDAR (ABL) utilizes water-penetrating green lasers to detect the water surface and bottom and to measure depth. An ABL survey can efficiently cover large areas and is suited to shallow waters, a risky area in ship-based multibeam echosounder surveys. The received ABL signal is a mixture of surface and bottom reflections and underwater backscattering. To obtain valid bathymetric data, the superimposed waveform must be decomposed into its individual components and classified to what level each component corresponds. In this study, we propose a classification algorithm based on machine learning for effective water labeling of ABL waveforms. It first decomposes each waveform into its Gaussian components and then extracts waveform features such as amplitude, width, and return number from each component. A Support Vector Machine (SVM), a machine learning technique, is applied with the extracted waveform features to assign them water surface, water column, and bottom labels. In addition, we extracted various types of waveform features, configured them in different combinations, and identified effective waveform features for water labeling. The proposed approach was evaluated on waveform data acquired from the shallow coastal waters using the Seahawk ABL system developed by the Ministry of Maritime Affairs and Fisheries of Korea. Accordingly, a waveform feature combination suitable for water labeling of Seahawk data using SVM was derived.","https://www.proquest.com/docview/2914746977?accountid=44943&bdid=84593&_bd=Y0WSa4e4JaNdFc9ZC3TbWpypN0U%3D","https://doi.org/10.2112/JCR-SI116-046.1"

In aerospace, returning all measured data to a central repository is prohibitively expensive, often causing useful, high-value data to be discarded. The ability to detect, prioritise and return useful data on asset and in real-time is vital to move toward more sustainable maintenance activities.We present a data-driven solution for on-line detection and prioritisation of anomalous data that is centrally processed and used to update individualised digital twins (DT) distributed onto remote machines. The DT is embodied as a convolutional neural network (CNN) optimised for real-time execution on a resource constrained gas turbine monitoring computer. The CNN generates a state prediction with uncertainty, which is used as a metric to select informative data for transfer to a remote fleet monitoring system. The received data is screened for faults before updating the weights on the CNN, which are synchronised between real and virtual asset.Results show the successful detection of a known in-flight engine fault and the collection of data related to high novelty pre-cursor events that were previously unrecognised. We demonstrate that data related to novel operation are also identified for transfer to the fleet monitoring system, allowing model improvement by retraining.

In this paper, we aim to assess the impact of maritime transport, related investment, and air pollution on economic growth within 20 countries of the European Union, using eight panel data regression models from 2007 to 2018. Our results confirm that maritime transport, air pollutants (NOx and SO2) from maritime transport, and investment in maritime port infrastructure are indeed positively correlated with economic growth. In other words, an increase of 10% in these factors has generated an associated increase in economic growth rate of around 1.6%, 0.4%, 0.8%, and 0.7% respectively. Alongside the intensity of economic maritime activities, pollution is positively correlated with economic growth, and thus it is recommended that policymakers and other involved stakeholders act to diminish environmental impacts in this sector using green investment in port infrastructure and ecological ships, in accordance with the current European trends and concerns.","https://www.proquest.com/docview/2554768776?accountid=44943&bdid=84593&_bd=ivS0s%2B9nJ%2FbWJ4WFfPruBSLpJHA%3D","https://doi.org/10.3390/su13147961"

The quantity of obtainable marine resources depending on maritime boundary acts as an important factor for maritime boundary delimitation. Accordingly, a study is required to calculate quantity of our obtainable marine resources depending on maritime boundary delimitation. This study intends to calculate obtainable marine resources depending on various maritime boundary scenarios insisted by several countries. It mainly aims at developing a GIS-based automation system to be utilized for decision making of the maritime boundary delimitation. For this target, it has designed a module using spatial analysis technique to automatically calculate profit and loss waters area of each country upon maritime boundary and another module to estimate economic profits and losses obtained by each country using the calculated waters area and pricing information of the marine resources. By linking both the designed modules, it has implemented an automatic economic profit and loss calculation system for the GIS-based maritime boundary delimitation.

This makes smooth operation of the maritime transport essential. However, the sector faces the constant risk of various crises and their potential consequences that may significantly impact and disrupt the movement of goods on local, regional, and global levels. In recent years, two notable crises, namely the COVID-19 pandemic and the war in Ukraine, have been observed. This paper aims to analyse how international crises, such as armed conflicts and pandemics, influence maritime traffic and assess their impact on both global and local economies. A comparison is drawn between the periods before and during the COVID-19 pandemic and before and during the war in Ukraine to exemplify the effects of crises. The findings are then extrapolated to apply to potential future crises. Vessel movements are studied using data collected from Automatic Identification Systems (AIS). In our quantitative approach, we analyse big data using dedicated tools and visualisation techniques to gain insights into specific phenomena. The paper identifies economically significant regions for maritime traffic and examines the impact of crises on their performance. Its unique value lies in its flow-based analysis of changes in maritime traffic. The main conclusion is that China's importance for worldwide maritime traffic is increasing. This makes the global economy heavily reliant on China to a substantially greater extent than it is, for example, on Russia. Consequently, any crisis in the China region could exert a dramatic impact on the global economy. The paper also discusses observations of changes in maritime traffic following the outbreak of the war in Ukraine.","https://www.proquest.com/docview/2928718710?accountid=44943&bdid=84593&_bd=yxHbgG47kwc%2BuV1cYu0j31pc994%3D","https://doi.org/10.1007/s11067-023-09612-0"

Stakeholders in maritime transport continue to exchange physical documents in order to conduct business. The monitoring of supply chain goods, communication among employees, environmental sustainability and longevity control, along with time framing, all create challenges to many industries. Everyday onboard work, such as cargo operations, navigation and various types of inspections in shipping, still requires paper documents and logs that need to be signed (and stamped). The conversion of traditional paper contracts into smart contracts, which can be digitalized and read through automation, provides a new wave of collaboration between eco systems across the shipping industry. Various data collected and stored on board ships could be used for scientific purposes. Distributed ledger technology (DLT) could be used to collect all those data and improve shipping operations by process expediting. It could eliminate the need to fill in various documents and logs and make operations safer and more environmentally friendly. Information about various important procedures onboard ships could be shared among all interested stakeholders. This paper considers the possible application of distributed ledger technology as an aid for the control of overboard discharge of wastewater from commercial ships. The intended outcome is that it could help protect the environment by sending data to relevant stakeholders in real time, thus providing information regarding the best discharge areas. The use of a structured communal data transference would ensure a consistent and accurate way to transmit data to all interested parties, and would eliminate the need to fill in various paper forms and logs. Wastewater overboard discharges would be properly monitored, recorded and measured, as distributed ledger technology would prevent any possibility of illegal actions and falsification of documents, thus ensuring environmental sustainability.","https://www.proquest.com/docview/2407073421?accountid=44943&bdid=84593&_bd=bxrwq%2FcfruXBGKpw2iJH3VehtOE%3D","https://doi.org/10.3390/jmse8050366"

More and more systems are adopting advances in science and engineering to reduce manual handling steps, thereby reducing transit time. Letter-of-Credit (LOC) is a standard method where the parties involved will enter into agreements for the sale and exchange of goods. Specifically, each party will receive a set of original documents and does not need to meet face-to-face under the bank’s witness. The process brings many benefits in terms of time and reduces records processing. However, the system faces a lot of risks when one of the parties is dishonest. On the other hand, the traditional LOC systems face a lot of risks related to the transparency of information about the goods, and also the supplier may lose the goods (e.g., 4/100 Vietnamese cashew nut containers are lost. stuck in Italy) or deposits in the hands of shipping companies (e.g., GNN Express - Vietnam) and many more. To this end, many research directions have exploited blockchain technology and smart contracts. Specifically, all information related to the transaction between the supplier and the demander including package, time, and delivery location. However, there needs to be a mechanism to ensure the smooth implementation of smart contracts, specifically for sanctioning when there is a conflict between a supplier and a demander. This role should be considered for the transaction manager, who directly designs and is responsible for their smart contracts. Currently, there is no mechanism to guarantee all interests of the parties involved in non-bank transactions. To increase the processing capacity and integrate with the Blockchain system, we propose the Letter-of-credit Chain that defines the agreements between the parties in international trade. We also deploy the proof-of-concept of the Letter-of-credit Chain on the three EVM-supported platforms (i.e., under ERC20), namely, Ethereum, Binance Smart Chain, and Fantom. By evaluating the actual execution of Gas for each platform, we found that our proposed model had the cheapest fee when deployed on the Fantom platform. Finally, we share the deployment/implementation of these platforms’ proof-of-concept to encourage further future research.","https://www.proquest.com/docview/2718751908?accountid=44943&bdid=84593&_bd=ddKLk6Dpm68jfOQSnyUbNmlJGSw%3D","https://doi.org/10.14569/IJACSA.2022.01308103"

The use of liquified natural gas (LNG) as a ship fuel is currently the most likely measure to meet this regulation, and LNG bunkering infrastructure investment and network planning are underway worldwide. Therefore, the aim of this study is to predict the LNG bunkering demand for investment and planning. So far, however, there has been little quantitative analysis of LNG bunkering demand prediction. In this study, first, the global LNG bunkering demand was predicted using meta-regression analysis. Global demand for LNG bunkering is forecast to increase from 16.6 million tons in 2025 to 53.2 million tons in 2040.

Using the method of purposive selection, Poland, which is well developed in logistics and aspires to be a crucial logistical hub of Europe, was selected for the study. The analysed period covered the years 2015–2021. The material sources were the literature on the subject and data from reports on individual logistics segments. Dynamic indicators with a fixed and variable base, coefficient of variation and Kendall’s tau correlation coefficient were used for analysis and presentation. It was found that the COVID-19 pandemic accelerated changes in logistics activities. These changes included digitalisation, the development of the e-commerce market, multi-channel sales and the development of these services, and the introduction of automation and artificial intelligence. In all activities, 2020 was the most challenging year, but there was generally a reduction in revenue growth and, less often, stagnation. Logistics companies gained in the second year of the pandemic (2021) when implemented solutions generated record revenues. Among the winning segments were logistics services in general, especially sea freight forwarding, warehousing services, courier services related to e-commerce, and a lesser extent, freight transport.

Nevertheless, machine learning methods lack the contextual reasoning capabilities and cannot be fitted to utilize additional information about circumstances, environments, backgrounds, etc. Such information provides essential knowledge about possible reasons for particular actions. This knowledge could not be processed directly by either machine learning methods. This paper presents the context-aware machine learning approach for actor behavior contextual reasoning analysis and context-based prediction for threat assessment. Moreover, the proposed approach uses context-aware prediction to tackle the interaction between actors. An idea of the technique lies in the cooperative use of two classification methods when one way predicts an actor’s behavior. The second method discloses such predicted action (behavior) that is non-typical or unusual. Such integration of two-method allows the actor to make the self-awareness threat assessment based on relations between different actors where some multidimensional numerical data define the connections. This approach predicts the possible further situation and makes its threat assessment without any waiting for future actions. The suggested approach is based on the Decision Tree and Support Vector Method algorithm. Due to the complexity of context, marine traffic data was chosen to demonstrate the proposed approach capability.

This article explores a new approach to the study of active sedimentation of residual and mixed fuels. An assessment of the sedimentation process during mixing, storage, and transportation of marine fuels is made based on estimation three-dimensional diagrams developed by the authors. In an effort to find the optimal solution, studies have been carried out to determine the influence of marine residual fuel compositions on sediment formation via machine learning algorithms. Thus, a model which can be used to predict incompatibilities in fuel compositions as well as sedimentation processes is proposed. The model can be used to determine the sediment content of mixed marine residual fuels with the desired sulfur concentration.","https://www.proquest.com/docview/2612783566?accountid=44943&bdid=84593&_bd=Rv%2FX7VClhEYEQ%2B%2FncFwKHeaJ6VQ%3D","https://doi.org/10.3390/en14248422"

However, reliable predictions of the severity of a season several months in advance would be useful for planning monitoring strategies and also for shipping companies in designing optimal routes across the North Atlantic for specific years. A seasonal forecast model of the build-up of seasonal iceberg numbers has recently become available, beginning to enable this longer-term planning of marine operations. Here we discuss extension of this control systems model to include more recent years within the trial ensemble sample set and also increasing the number of measures of the iceberg season that are considered within the forecast. These new measures include the seasonal iceberg total, the rate of change of the seasonal increase, the number of peaks in iceberg numbers experienced within a given season, and the timing of the peak(s). They are predicted by a range of machine learning tools. The skill levels of the new measures are tested, as is the impact of the extensions to the existing seasonal forecast model.

However, stricter rules and regulations that aim at the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions published by the International Maritime Organization, force shipping companies to increase the operational efficiency of their fleet. The prediction of a ship speed in actual seas with a given power by its engine is the most important performance indicator and thus makes it the “holy grail” in pursuing better efficiency. Traditionally, tank model tests and semi-empirical formulas were the preferred solution for the aforementioned prediction and are still widely applied. However, currently, with the increased computational power that is widely available, novel and more sophisticated methods taking into consideration computational fluid dynamics (CFD) and machine learning (ML) algorithms are emerging. In this paper, we briefly present the different approaches in the prediction of a ship’s speed but focus on ML methods comparing a representative number of the latest data-driven models used in papers, to provide guidelines, discover trends and identify the challenges to be faced by researchers. From this comparison, we can distinguish that artificial neural networks (ANN), being used in 73.3% of the reviewed papers, dominate as the algorithm of choice. Researchers mostly rely on physical laws governing the phenomena in the crucial part of data preprocessing tasks.

Studies on both quayside and landside planning are grouped in five research clusters: discussing simulation, scheduling, automation, quayside operations, integrated operations and container transportation. In addition, the evolution of optimization techniques in planning container terminal operations is discussed, along with the suggested trajectory of the research agenda under each cluster. The analysis finds that genetic algorithms, integer linear programming and heuristics are the most widely used operations research techniques in container terminal optimization. While clusters of research in areas such as simulating container terminal operations, scheduling operations and automated terminals have received a great deal of attention, research focusing on integrated and dynamic operations has been scarce over the past years, suggesting a new area of contributions.

However, waterway depth data measured during actual maritime navigation is limited, and the depth values can have large variability. Big data collected in real time by automatic identification systems (AIS) might provide a way to estimate accurate waterway depths, although these data include no direct channel depth information. We suggest a deep neural network (DNN) based model, called DDTree, for using the real-time AIS data and the data from Global Mapper to predict waterway depth for ships in an accurate and timely way. The model combines a decision tree and DNN, which is trained and tested on the AIS and Global Mapper data from the Nantong and Fangcheng ports on the southeastern and southwestern coast of China. The actual waterway depth data were used together with the AIS data as the input to DDTree. The latest data on waterway depths from the Chinese maritime agency were used to verify the results. The experiments show that the DDTree model has a prediction accuracy of 91.15%. Therefore, the DDTree model can provide an accurate prediction of waterway depth and compensate for the shortage of waterway depth monitoring means.

However, due to the lack of base stations (BSs), how to complete rescue while maintaining communication between vehicles is an unresolved challenge. In this paper, we design an efficient and fault-tolerant communication solution by jointly optimizing vehicles' trajectory, offloading scheduling, and routing topology for a heterogeneous vehicle system. First, we model several essential factors in maritime SAR, including the impact of ocean currents, the observational behavior of UAVs, the fault tolerance of relay networks, resource management of mobile edge computing (MEC), and energy consumption. A multi-objective optimization problem is formulated, aiming at minimizing time and energy consumption while increasing the fault tolerance of relay networks. Then, we transfer the objective into a decentralized partially observable Markov Decision Process (Dec-POMDP) and introduce multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) to search for a collaborative strategy. Specifically, two MARL approaches with different training styles are evaluated, and three techniques are added for improving performance, including sharing parameters , normalized generalized-advantage-estimation (GAE), and preserving-outputs-precisely-while-adaptively-rescaling-targets (Pop-Art).

To meet the objectives of increased automation under the threat of cyber attacks, the different software modules that are expected to be involved in different navigational functions need to be prepared to detect such attacks utilizing suitable detection techniques.

Traditional ship energy efficiency monitoring is based on the noon reports, which are susceptible to human error and have a time delay. Many ship energy efficiency monitoring systems have been designed and developed, but they usually cannot send data to the shore in time. In order to identify abnormal fuel consumption in time, this paper realizes a big data collection system for ship energy efficiency monitoring based on the BeiDou System. The system installed on two sister container ships has already collected a lot of data. Big data analysis methods, such as principal component analysis (PCA) and correlation analysis, are applied in the system to realize data visualization and analysis. Using PCA, it turns out that the shaft power of the main engine is related to a certain ship speed, which is also affected by load and weather conditions, and is the biggest factor in determining fuel consumption. To realize the assessment of hull fouling and the optimization of ship trim, a useful physics-based analysis is proposed. The analysis shows that the fouling of ship body greatly increases its resistance. Our analysis method can also find the best trim under specific loading condition.

Beresford","Supply Chain Management","Scholarly Journals","","18","3","2013-05-01","2013","235","","235-252","13598546","","","ENG","Purpose - The changing role of seaports in supply chains has been the subject of extensive research in the recent literature. The strategic development of seaport terminals, responding to the need for closer integration into supply chains, invites a more detailed examination of the influence of the supply chain structures on seaport performance. Therefore, this paper aims to investigate the effects of supply chain structures, especially the degree of integration of seaports into supply chains, on seaport performance. Design/methodology/approach - The parameters for a structural equation model were identified in the first instance from the supply chain and seaport operations and management literature. The structural equation model itself was then devised, and subsequently refined, using data from Korean seaport terminal operators, shipping companies and freight forwarding companies. The structural equation model was used to assess the level of supply chain integration of seaports and the relationship to port performance. Findings - The results indicate that the integration of seaports into supply chains has a positive impact on both the effectiveness and the efficiency of seaport performance. In addition, antecedents to seaport supply chain integration are identified; these suggest that a strong orientation to supply chain integration within a port operating company enables the company to adopt and implement a strategy that integrates functions within the port and with other upstream and downstream organisations. Research limitations/implications - As the field data were geographically limited to one country, extending the findings of this study to other geographical areas may not be possible, although the approach taken, using the structural equation modelling technique, should be transferrable elsewhere. Cross-validation of the model would widen its applicability to other areas. The paper provides a framework that allows other researchers to examine the level of integration of ports into supply chains. Practical implications - The potential benefits of closer integration of seaports into supply chains are shown with supply chain integration having a positive effect on port performance. Seaports which do not integrate with their supply chains have a lower level of performance. Thus, enhanced port performance accruing from closer integration would have positive implications both for port and terminal managers and for other supply chain participants. Originality/value - This study, for the first time, empirically examines the impact of the integration into supply chains of seaports on their performance. This is achieved by the development of a structural equation model which is then tested in the field, thus extending the existing literature which is largely conceptual or descriptive.","https://www.proquest.com/docview/1365828675?accountid=44943&bdid=84593&_bd=nVZOE796Xzwae%2BVVFZANlath26s%3D","https://doi.org/10.1108/SCM-09-2011-0264"

Large ports such as Rotterdam or Antwerp are already heavily investing in digital databased technologies and thus, continue to rely on a sustainable expansion of these advanced technologies that promise security, process optimization and sustainability. Conversely, especially smaller ports have no or limited knowledge on what Industry 4.0, IoT and Blockchain are and what potentials they may have. Nevertheless, without the inclusion of small and medium-sized ports, the innovative idea towards a smart port development stays unachievable. Related to this, there exist a lack of concepts and models for measuring the digital performance of ports. Without such tools, it is impossible to audit the digital status of ports and to derive a concrete strategic roadmap for the digital transformation of ports. Accordingly, in this study, the research questions will be investigated, how the digital performance of ports can be assessed, and which strategic recommendations can be derived for ports regarding a sustainable development towards a smart port. Building upon the received qualitative data that were gathered through an online survey and IT based expert interviews, a digital readiness index for ports is applied in case of five selected seaports. The results will show that building upon the benchmarking and indexing of the ports, the current strategic positioning of the ports becomes apparent.

Background and Objectives: Maritime pine (Pinus pinaster Aiton) forests in Portugal were lately affected by wildfires and measures to overcome this situation are needed. The aims of this study were: (1) to model species’ spatial distribution and productivity using a machine learning (ML) regression approach to produce current species’ distribution and productivity maps; (2) to model the species’ spatial productivity using a stochastic sequential simulation approach to produce the species’ current productivity map; (3) to produce the species’ potential distribution map, by using a ML classification approach to define species’ ecological envelope thresholds; and (4) to identify present and future key factors for the species’ afforestation and management. Materials and Methods: Spatial land cover/land use data, inventory, and environmental data (climate, topography, and soil) were used in a coupled ML regression and stochastic sequential simulation approaches to model species’ current and potential distributions and productivity. Results: Maritime pine spatial distribution modelling by the ML approach provided 69% fitting efficiency, while species productivity modelling achieved only 43%. The species’ potential area covered 60% of the country’s area, where 78% of the species’ forest inventory plots (1995) were found. The change in the Maritime pine stands’ age structure observed in the last decades is causing the species’ recovery by natural regeneration to be at risk. Conclusions: The maps produced allow for best site identification for species afforestation, wood production regulation support, landscape planning considering species’ diversity, and fire hazard mitigation. These maps were obtained by modelling using environmental covariates, such as climate attributes, so their projection in future climate change scenarios can be performed.","https://www.proquest.com/docview/2535400492?accountid=44943&bdid=84593&_bd=dyxl%2FzwZbREzjnZ863L3arJrJOE%3D","https://doi.org/10.3390/f12030368"

In this paper, we analyse the application of blockchain to reduce the trade costs of producing and coordinating trusted information along supply chains. Consumers, producers, and governments increasingly demand information about the quality, characteristics, and provenance of traded goods. Partially due to the risks of error and fraud, this information is costly to produce and to maintain between dispersed parties. Recent efforts have sought to overcome these costs—such as paperless trade agendas—through the application of new technologies. Our focus is on how blockchain technology can form a new decentralized economic infrastructure for supply chains by governing decentralized dynamic ledgers of information about goods as they move. We outline the potential economic consequences of blockchain supply chains before examining policy. Effective adoption faces a range of policy challenges including regulatory recognition and interoperability across jurisdictions.

In supply chains, physical and information flows have strict service quality requirements, namely transparency conditions and traceability. Seaports, connecting land and maritime transport, are special components of supply chains where multiple players interact with different perspectives, and conflicting goals may arise. Port community authorities invest in electronic platforms to foster communication and integration with the companies that interact with the seaport, guiding the digitization of the seaport business. In main European and world ports, the Port Community System (PCS) is the platform that supports the creation of a network composed of shipping agents, shippers, freight forwarders, transporters, terminals, logistics platforms, and public entities. PCS focuses on service level, partner networks, maritime services, freight services, logistical services, and advanced port services. These features have an impact on seaport operations, which affects supply chain performance. Digitization within the scope of the PCSs has fostered the development of horizontal collaboration between seaport community partners. The Physical Internet (PI) is an innovative concept that seeks new logistics solutions requiring integration and interoperability between partners in the supply chain, including maritime and land transport. This paper focuses on (i) the evolution guidelines of PCSs and (ii) on the PCS Business Factors that can drive the supply chain into a significant improvement in performance. A survey was sent to a sample of Portuguese supply chain experts regarding the causal relationship between PCS Business Factors and supply chain performance in the next 10 to 20 years. From the data collected, recent services evolving at PCS are promoting a mindset change aligned to the implementation of a Physical Internet. Establishing a Physical Internal in Portuguese seaports could take decades, but it will support the transition to a new phase of PCS, accelerating the transition from Isolated Supply Chains (I-SCs) to Open Supply Chains (O-SCs), thus improving supply chain performance.","https://www.proquest.com/docview/2632821848?accountid=44943&bdid=84593&_bd=wa91v8KGvJJmiQWlay2pBm1SdC0%3D","https://doi.org/10.3390/jmse10020152"

In the experiment, big data of Internet of Things (IoT) were collected to analyze the sailing conditions for over six months through global satellite communications while the ship sailed across the ocean. The results showed that deep draft results in a better performance than shallow draft; that is, the ship carries more cargo but consumes less fuel oil, as opposed to the traditional concept. Among the parameters, the draft and cargo mass interacts with the index to identify the fuel consumption at a constant speed; A draft between 11.5 m and 12 m was found to be optimum for this type of container ship. The EEOI is a metric tool to illustrate the variation of fuel consumption and an effective management strategy to reduce the CO2 emission quantity.

The sustainability and competitive advantage of seaport businesses depend on their ability to adapt to changing business requirements, while Industrial Revolution 4.0 (IR 4.0) is a current phenomenon that connects the global market through smart technologies involving cyber-physical systems to overcome global trade uncertainty. However, focusing only on growing economic benefits might lead to an ineffective sustainable implementation of IR 4.0 within a seaport system. Therefore, this paper compares the current status of IR 4.0 global implementation against the current Malaysian seaport system to ensure that the development of seaports in Malaysia is aligned with technological trends and global requirements. In addition, this paper investigates the critical sustainable factors (CSFs) for the implementation of IR 4.0 in Malaysian seaports. A Focus Group Discussion (FGD) is used to obtain the data from 13 domain experts, from various maritime stakeholders, which is further analysed by using Thematic Analysis. The result has shown that most seaports have started to initiate a fusion by focusing on IR 4.0 adaptation. In contrast, in Malaysia, the seaports in this country are still behind the global trend and are just starting to explore the concept of IR 4.0 instead of expanding to the next level (global benchmark). The current status and CSFs, for the implementation of IR 4.0 in Malaysian seaports, are presented in comparison to global requirements, and the marginal associations between them are shown.

At the same time, there is a growing demand for information necessary to mitigate the consequences. To minimise the damage and increase the resilience of supply chains, it is necessary to identify sources of threats promptly, the extent of possible damage and the possibility of preventing or minimising their impact. The aim of the paper is to structure supply chain threats and search for appropriate datasets for prevention. Methodology: The paper analyses the state-of-the-art through a comprehensive literature review and demonstrates secondary data about how free-access business data can be used as Early Warning Signals to forecast supply chain disruptive events, with a particular focus on international maritime transportation. Results: It was confirmed that companies can access many open datasets, and collecting and aggregating these data can improve their preparedness for future disruptive events. As the most important issue, the authors defined the selection of proper datasets and interpreting results with foresight. Conclusions: Identifying and analysing the relevant Early Warning Signals by companies to prevent supply chain disruptions are essential for keeping their supply chains sustainable and their resilience on a sufficient level. It was proved that general business indicators (PMI delivery time, container capacity, inflation rate, etc.) can help to signal the increasing possibility of maritime traffic problems in ports and container unavailability as usual supply chain disruption types in recent years. Therefore, the companies in the supply chains need to find, collect and analyse the appropriate data, which are, in some cases, free and available.

In the shipping market, it allows for a wide spectrum of integration of corporate management areas: shipowners’ financial condition, environmental protection, work safety, seafarers’ health, and stable cooperation with shippers. The aim of this paper is to create a deeper understanding of how and which emerging technologies accelerate sustainability strategy of shipping companies. Three research perspectives have been adopted. The first one is aimed to examine shipowners’ approach to emerging technologies as a tool to improve their corporate sustainability performance. The second perspective gives a view of trends in the development of emerging technologies in shipping and how they related to sustainability. Taking the third perspective, we examine how effective, in the opinion of future seafarers, the use of emerging technologies is in improving corporate sustainability of shipping companies.

Despite the advantages of its simplicity and efficiency, the requirement of trained operators proficient in Morse code and maintaining stable sending speed pose a key challenge to this traditional manual signaling manner. To overcome these problems, an automatic system is needed to provide a partial substitute for human effort. However, few works have focused on studying an automatic recognition scheme of maritime manually sent-like optical Morse signals. To this end, this paper makes the first attempt to design and implement a robust real-time automatic recognition prototype for onboard Morse lamps. A modified k-means clustering algorithm of machine learning is proposed to optimize the decision threshold and identify elements in Morse light signals. A systematic framework and detailed recognition algorithm procedure are presented. The feasibility of the proposed system is verified via experimental tests using a light-emitting diode (LED) array, self-designed receiver module, and microcontroller unit (MCU). Experimental results indicate that over 99% of real-time recognition accuracy is realized with a signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) greater than 5 dB, and the system can achieve good robustness under conditions with low SNR.","https://www.proquest.com/docview/2630512930?accountid=44943&bdid=84593&_bd=8EpiP830E9faDU4QnVF0yB3WEUk%3D","https://doi.org/10.3390/app10041227"

Key stakeholders in this effort include maritime institutions and shipping companies. However, effectively organizing information from ship emission monitoring, especially for policy implementation in the expansion of emission control areas (ECAs), faces substantial obstacles in data acquisition, transmission, analysis, and information services. To address these challenges, this study suggests an Internet of Things (IoT) paradigm using drones and deep learning for ship emission monitoring in the port areas, integrating vital technologies such as industrial contact elements for the IoT, assisted processing of ship emission, real-time data monitoring and online processing, and tailored information services for port control center. In addition, the suggested IoT paradigm considers adversarial and false data injection (FDI) assaults, which impair the effectiveness of data processing and identification techniques. By actively supporting green port trends and maritime law enforcement, this new IoT paradigm is developing into the framework of the berth area inside the physical infrastructure. Furthermore, this model highlights the possibility for a more widespread adoption of ship pollution monitoring while simultaneously demonstrating the model’s efficacy in the current setting. A more expansive version of the suggested IoT paradigm might function as a strong cyber-physical infrastructure, supporting the capacity for thorough ship emission monitoring and enabling in-depth study on ship emissions.","https://www.proquest.com/docview/2973238329?accountid=44943&bdid=84593&_bd=0AUjhbs01w413dr2sPrzMVNQ5hQ%3D","https://doi.org/10.1109/TIM.2024.3374306"

Environmental or safety applications and the growing area of fleet management all benefit from accident detection contributions by minimizing the risk vehicles and drivers are subject to, improving their service and reducing overhead costs. Some solutions have been proposed in the past literature for automated accident detection that are mainly based on traffic data or external sensors. However, traffic data can be difficult to access, while external sensors can end up being difficult to set up and unreliable, depending on how they are used. Additionally, the scarcity of accident detection data has limited the type of approaches used in the past, leaving in particular, machine learning (ML) relatively unexplored. Thus, in this paper, we propose a ML framework for automated car accident detection based on mutimodal in-car sensors. Our work is a unique and innovative study on detecting real-world driving accidents by applying state-of-the-art feature extraction methods using basic sensors in cars. In total, five different feature extraction approaches, including techniques based on feature engineering and feature learning with deep learning are evaluated on the strategic highway research program (SHRP2) naturalistic driving study (NDS) crash data set. The main observations of this study are as follows: (1) CNN features with a SVM classifier obtain very promising results, outperforming all other tested approaches.

In this paper, a novel approach was proposed to extract massive featured data from the AIS database. An Evidential Reasoning rule based methodology was proposed to simulate the procedure of extracting routes from AIS database artificially. First, the frequency distributions of ship dynamic attributes, such as the mean and variance of Speed over Ground, Course over Ground, are obtained, respectively, according to the verified AIS data samples. Subsequently, the correlations between the attributes and belief degrees of the categories are established based on likelihood modeling. In this case, the attributes were characterized into several pieces of evidence, and the evidence can be combined with the Evidential Reasoning rule. In addition, the weight coefficients were trained in a nonlinear optimization model to extract the AIS data more accurately.

The community structures of port microbes from marine and freshwater habitats house relatively similar phyla, despite spanning large spatial scales. As part of this project, we collected 1,218 surface water samples from 604 locations across eight countries and three continents to catalogue a total of 20 shipping ports distributed across the East and West Coast of the United States, Europe, and Asia to represent the largest study of port-associated microbial communities to date. Here, we demonstrated the utility of machine learning to leverage this robust system to characterize microbial biogeography by identifying trends in biodiversity across broad spatial scales. We found that for geographic locations sharing similar environmental conditions, subpopulations from the dominant phyla of these habitats (Actinobacteria, Bacteroidetes, Cyanobacteria, and Proteobacteria) can be used to differentiate 20 geographic locations distributed globally. These results suggest that despite the overwhelming diversity within microbial communities, members of the most abundant and ubiquitous microbial groups in the system can be used to differentiate a geospatial location across global spatial scales. Our study provides insight into how microbes are dispersed spatially and robust methods whereby we can interrogate microbial biogeography.IMPORTANCE Microbes are ubiquitous throughout the world and are highly diverse. Characterizing the extent of variation in the microbial diversity across large geographic spatial scales is a challenge yet can reveal a lot about what biogeography can tell us about microbial populations and their behavior. Machine learning approaches have been used mostly to examine the human microbiome and, to some extent, microbial communities from the environment. Here, we display how supervised machine learning approaches can be useful to understand microbial biodiversity and biogeography using microbes from globally distributed shipping ports. Our findings indicate that the members of globally dominant phyla are important for differentiating locations, which reduces the reliance on rare taxa to probe geography. Further, this study displays how global biogeographic patterning of aquatic microbial communities (and other systems) can be assessed through populations of the highly abundant and ubiquitous taxa that dominant the system.","https://www.proquest.com/docview/2368693456?accountid=44943&bdid=84593&_bd=UC1LxGl7W8f%2F0vzfS5z1Pmqh54M%3D","https://doi.org/10.1128/mSphere.00481-19"

As drones are used in vital operations, ensuring cyberattacks and anomalies protect them from attackers is now a big challenge. This research study presents a complete approach to enhancing drone safety by integrating multi-sensor anomaly detection and superior machine learning techniques. The proposed methodology capitalizes on the rich sensor suite embedded in present-day drones, encompassing GPS receivers, accelerometers, gyroscopes, cameras, communication modules, and more. Leveraging an array of sensors in drones, our technique detects abnormal drone behavior indicative of unauthorized access, GPS spoofing, communication jamming, and malicious activities. By extracting features from sensor records, we develop a robust anomaly detection framework using the “uav attack dataset” able to identify deviations from normal flight patterns, communication signals, and environmental interactions. Central to our methodology is the utilization of machine learning algorithms. These algorithms are skilled on labeled datasets containing numerous flight eventualities, each normal and hostile, together with the ones discovered inside the “uav attack dataset”. The obtained results are eventually evaluated using rigorous performance metrics to quantify their effectiveness in distinguishing genuine anomalies from benign variations. The findings of our study underscore the capacity of multi-sensor anomaly detection for drones. By harnessing the power of machine learning and sensor fusion, we exhibit the ability to hit upon attacks at an early level, mitigating capability harm and permitting rapid responses. This study contributes now not only to the field of drone safety but also to the broader panorama of self-sustaining systems protection, highlighting the importance of adaptive and proactive protection mechanisms.

Autonomy is described as a multi-faceted construct including self-sufficiency and self-directedness, which are related to a range of conditions a ship can deal with. This means that autonomy levels will vary in different operational situations. As a consequence, active operator involvement and workload will fluctuate and will sometimes be unpredictable. In case of supervising multiple ships, it is not feasible to maintain a minimal level of situation awareness of all the ships. In order to facilitate operator situation awareness recovery and other human-automation collaboration principles an Intelligent Operator Support System concept is outlined. Whether the large-scale application of Maritime Autonomous Surface Ships will provide equivalent safety and resilience levels will largely depend on the intelligence of the onboard control systems, the design quality of the human-autonomy collaboration system, and the competence and training level of the SC-operators.","https://www.proquest.com/docview/2562789591?accountid=44943&bdid=84593&_bd=dOuXYmqj5GJzUH%2Fqd4EFO%2FCLCNQ%3D","https://doi.org/10.1088/1757-899X/929/1/012008"

The objective of the article is to contribute to the identification of different types of political risks along the Silk Road Economic Belt and 21st Century Maritime Silk Road, and the visualization of their micro-level spatial distribution based on the Global Database of Events, Language, and Tone (GDELT) datasets from October 2013 to May 2018. By adopting the bivariate Moran’s I model to compare the distribution of political risks along the Belt and Road and that of the Chinese Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) investment and construction projects based on data from the China Global Investment Tracker (CGIT), the article also generates an overall political risk profile for Chinese BRI projects. Our findings show that a particularly high percentage of Chinese BRI projects are distributed in regions with high political risks. This research has important implications for the discussion and study of the BRI. First, by combining geographic spatial statistical analysis and political science conceptual frameworks, we point out the necessity to query the BRI from interdisciplinary perspectives grounded in empirical research. Second, the research delivers to researchers, academics, practitioners, consultants and policy makers interested in the BRI the latest insights into the risks and challenges along the Belt and Road.

This study, finds that India can leverage on the 7,500 long coast line and derive holistic development in terms of interconnected ports with hinterland connectivity and realize lower expenditure coupled with reduced carbon emission. This research analyzed a decade of cargo data from origination to destination and found that around 82.95 per cent (953 MMTPA in 2017–18) of road based consignments in India comprised of Fertilizers, Hydrocarbons, Coal, Lubricants and Oil. Essentially, a quantum of this i.e. 78.39 per cent of MMTPA cargo consignments (State Owned Hydrocarbons) traverses on Indian roads. The study drew parameters of this transportation paradigm and modeled the same using Artificial Intelligence to depict a monumental opportunity to rationalize costs, improve efficiency and reduce carbon emission to strengthen the argument for the employment of Multimodal Logistics in the Maritime Sector. Subsequent to model derivation the same set of parameters are plotted as an efficient transit map of Interstate transit lines connecting 16 major hubs which now handle bulk cargo shipped by all modes of transport. For the pollution segment a collaborative game theoretic approach i.e., Shapley value is proposed for improved decision making. This study presents data driven and compelling research evidence to portray the benefits of collaboration between firms in terms of time and cost.

MAIN ARGUMENT The People's Republic of China (PRC) is attempting to incrementally reshape the global order through the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI). To this end, it is using-among other means-new disruptive technologies that will allow it to dominate data and communications in the political, economic, and social realms across the large expanse of the initiative. The Digital Silk Road has been a part of the PRC's approach since at least 2015, when it first appeared in a government white paper on BRI. The Digital Silk Road binds together new technologies in ""bundles,"" such as smart cities, smart ports, and satellite-networked communications, using 5G as a baseline for other technologies like artificial intelligence, data analytics, and the Internet of Things. Success in using this communications infrastructure to dominate markets, standards, and political elites would give China a multiregional base from which to project its norms, systems, and networks to the wider global market. In the long run, this will not only give a competitive advantage to Chinese companies but also allow them to spread more widely across remaining markets. POLICY IMPLICATIONS • The Digital Silk Road has deep geopolitical implications. Building the backbone of communications infrastructure in BRI countries will allow the PRC to access, analyze, and exploit in real time the large data sets of recipient countries. • Through these technologies and its tech companies, the PRC is exporting its governance model, surveillance system, and financial institutions. • Policy elites in recipient nations could become vulnerable to even greater influence operations as Chinese tech companies administer their networks in real time and collaborate with stage actors like the United Work Front Department. • The PRC could use the centralization of data in smart port systems to create a deniable, surgical sanctions system by interdicting or slowing the container traffic of states or their leaders.","https://www.proquest.com/docview/2355329399?accountid=44943&bdid=84593&_bd=j9G3Yf0Uj%2BU7gDaXFcRU7wy1A%2BQ%3D",""

However, covering numerous IoT targets with a minimal number of satellites poses a challenge. This article proposes a solution known as the 5S payload designed for S-IoT. The 5S payload integrates five subsystems into a single unit, comprising the following components: 1) automatic identification system (AIS) for ship surveillance; 2) very high-frequency data exchange system (VDES) enabling two-way communication for ships; 3) automatic dependent surveillance-broadcast (ADS-B) system for aircraft surveillance; 4) data collection system (DCS) for user-defined sensors; and 5) emergency search and rescue (ESR) system. The design of the 5S payload adheres to the CubeSat standard and occupies a compact 1.5U size, enabling rapid manufacturing and deployment. The feasibility of the 5S payload was demonstrated on the TianTuo-5 satellite launched on 23 August 2020.

Utilizing unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) technology to facilitate the transfer of data from buoy sensor nodes, it becomes feasible to significantly reduce the latency generated in the transmission process. Therefore, we introduce a UAV-assisted maritime Internet of Things (MIoT) data collection mechanism based on relay cooperation. In this mechanism, through relay transmissions among UAVs, it avoids UAVs located distant from the shipboard station from having to traverse extensive distances in order to offload data to the shipboard station. Based on this, we propose a deep reinforcement learning-based cooperative data collection (DCDC) scheme. In this scheme, firstly, we select the convergence node in charge of forwarding the data from buoy sensor nodes to the passing UAVs. Next, to achieve dynamic adaptation of the task areas for UAVs, we propose an adaptive partition algorithm based on virtual moving points. Subsequently, to establish relay transmission links between UAVs, we present a routing algorithm based on matching game theory. Finally, to reduce time costs in delivering collected data to the shipboard station, we utilize a deep reinforcement learning algorithm based on multi-agent deep deterministic policy gradient (MADDPG) plan the flight paths of UAVs. Additionally, we introduce virtual waypoints in the path planning algorithm, which enables that paired UAVs can high-efficiently perform data forwarding through encounter opportunities.

The products are extracted periodically or quantitatively for inspection in order to observe the relationship between process variation and engineering specification. When these irregularities are not instantly detected by lot sampling inspection, lot defectives are produced, and the defective cost increases. Failure to identify defects during sampling inspection leads to product returns or harm to business reputation. Press casting is a common mass production method in the metal industry. After the metal is molten at a high temperature, high pressure is injected into the mold, and then it is solidified and formed in the mold. Thus, pressure stability inside the mold is one of the key factors that influences quality. The melting point of aluminum alloy is normally around 650 °C, but there was no sensor that could withstand this high temperature. To combat this, we developed a high temperature resistant sensor and installed it into pressure casting mold grounded on the principles of fluid mechanics and experts’ suggestions in order to realize the impact of pressure change on the mold. To our limited knowledge, it was a seminal study on predicting mold’s casting quality via in-mold pressure data. We propose a press casting quality prediction method based on machine learning. By collecting the in-mold pressure data in real time. Savitzky-Golay Filter is used for data smoothing, and first-order difference is taken to extract the time interval of an actual injection of molten metal in-to the mold. We extract the key data that influence the quality and employ XGBoost to establish a classifier. In the experiment we prove that the method achieves good accuracy of quality prediction and recall of defectives for in-mold pressure. Via this model, we not only can save large amount of time and costs, but also can carry out maintenance warnings in advance, notify professionals to stop produce defective products, reduce the shipping risk and maintain reputation so as to strengthen its competitive edge.","https://www.proquest.com/docview/2693976970?accountid=44943&bdid=84593&_bd=ajd1y22DfZglVGpY1byW%2FYro3Sg%3D","https://doi.org/10.3390/electronics11142204"

Hence, to mitigate the security risk introduced by cyber threat actors, the industry, like any other, should initially focus on identifying its most critical assets and then adopt risk mitigation measures, spreading from legislative initiatives to company-specific technology solutions. Industry-led initiatives should promote the adoption of cyber-related policies and mechanisms that focus on business continuity. It should be the role of international bodies, classification societies and national authorities to ensure compliance and full implementation of these measures. This paper adopts a System of Systems Analysis to carry out a vulnerability assessment of port and ship ecosystem, while providing insights on the role of the aforementioned entities. Our analysis decomposes the industry’s major assets; ports and ships, to specific subcomponents which are used as the basis of the vulnerability assessment. According to our findings, this approach highlights that the majority of these subcomponents; ports and ships, are increasingly vulnerable to cyber attacks.","https://www.proquest.com/docview/2728486865?accountid=44943&bdid=84593&_bd=4lhqHLtEYjdivEJSjDBqvU%2BBrF0%3D","https://doi.org/10.3390/jmse10101486"

An optimized collision avoidance decision-making system is proposed in this paper, which involves risk appetite (RA) as the orientation. The RA oriented collision avoidance decision-making system (RA-CADMS) is developed based on human-machine interaction during ship collision avoidance, while being consistent with the International Regulations for Preventing Collisions at Sea (COLREGS) and Ordinary Practice of Seamen (OPS).

It brings significant economic profit along with bioinvasion risk. Species translocate and establish in a non-native area through ballast water and biofouling. Aiming at aquatic bioinvasion issue, people proposed various suggestions for bioinvasion management. Nonetheless, these suggestions only focus on the chance of a port been affected but ignore the port’s ability to further spread the invaded species.ResultsTo tackle the issues of the existing work, we propose a biosecurity triggering mechanism, where the bioinvasion risk of a port is estimated according to both the invaded risk of a port and its power of being a stepping-stone. To compute the invaded risk, we utilize the automatic identification system data, the ballast water data and marine environmental data. According to the invaded risk of ports, we construct a species invasion network (SIN). The incoming bioinvasion risk is derived from invaded risk data while the invasion risk spreading capability of each port is evaluated by s-core decomposition of SIN.ConclusionsWe illustrate 100 ports in the world that have the highest bioinvasion risk when the invaded risk and stepping-stone bioinvasion risk are equally treated. There are two bioinvasion risk intensive regions, namely the Western Europe (including the Western European margin and the Mediterranean) and the Asia-Pacific, which are just the region with a high growth rate of non-indigenous species and the area that has been identified as a source for many of non-indigenous species discovered elsewhere (especially the Asian clam, which is assumed to be the most invasive species worldwide).","https://www.proquest.com/docview/2090510608?accountid=44943&bdid=84593&_bd=SAxkpOVYNpAAPkBmnu4NZSm7dFU%3D","https://doi.org/10.1186/s12859-018-2272-5"

This paper proposes a generalised Bayesian inference-based artificial intelligence that is capable of identifying these patterns of moving objects based on their dynamic attributes and historical data. First of all, based on dependable prior data, likelihood information about objects of interest is obtained in terms of dynamic attributes, such as speed, direction and position. Observations on these attributes of a new object can be obtained as pieces of evidence profiled as probability distributions or generally belief distributions if ambiguity appears in the observations. Using likelihood modelling, the observed pieces of evidence are independent of the prior distribution patterns. Subsequently, Dempster’s rule is used to combine the pieces of evidence under consideration of their weight and reliability to identify the moving object. A real world case study of maritime radar surveillance is conducted to validate and prove the efficiency of the proposed approach. Overall, this approach is capable of providing a probabilistic and rigorous recognition result for pattern recognition of moving objects, which is suitable for any other actively detecting applications in transportation systems.","https://www.proquest.com/docview/2550270508?accountid=44943&bdid=84593&_bd=TeGCISsgOG8loe5vF7%2BRf9aHisc%3D","https://doi.org/10.3390/sym11020188"

Then, Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost), a machine learning algorithm, was utilized to explore the intrinsic impacts of various factors on fuel consumption with the outputs providing the evaluation basis for individual awareness of the drivers. The results show a significant deviation in the driver’s awareness of fuel-saving factors, among which the three indicators of engine speed, idling condition, and rolling without engine load are seriously underestimated, while the indicators related to the environment are seriously overestimated due to social expectations. In addition, the average speed was found to be the most important fuel-saving indicator besides the load.

The many-to-many concept assumes a stage in human-automation collaboration design where supervision of maritime autonomous surface ships is not permanently required anymore. Only in extreme and very rare situations the human may need to intervene. One of the challenges is balancing the task assignments and support functions over the operators to ensure the cognitive task load matches the operator’s mental capacity. For this purpose we introduce and described a dynamic task allocation algorithm. Also, human attention is limited and operators therefore must constantly shift attention resulting in moment-to-moment fluctuations in situation awareness. To overcome these reductions in situation awareness, operators must reassess the environment to recover situation awareness. We introduce the concept of continuous risk assessment to initiate the process of situation awareness recovery. Furthermore, the many-to-many ratio between supervising operators and autonomous ships implies that operators will not be able to supervise all ships in parallel. This makes current supervisory control interfaces less suitable. Instead we opt to apply the idea of progressive disclosure in the operator’s interface and interactions. The work described in this paper is directed towards developing an intelligent operator support system with which the operator support functions will be demonstrated as part of a Robotic Container Handling System, an innovation of the European MOSES research project.","https://www.proquest.com/docview/2698676902?accountid=44943&bdid=84593&_bd=DPxF3lD9P2%2FDG98OFVTPZjGwfGY%3D","https://doi.org/10.1088/1742-6596/2311/1/012032"

Thus, this manuscript aims at enabling analytics-driven improvements in the port transportation processes efficiency by streamlining the related information flow, i.e., by attaining shorter time frames of the information and document sharing among the export stakeholders. We developed a case study in a mid-sized European port, in which we applied Process Mining (PM)—an emerging type of business analytics—to a seven-month dataset from the freight export process. Four process inefficiencies and an issue that can jeopardize the reliability of the time performance measurements were detected, and we proposed a draft of solutions to cope with them. PM enabled enhancements in the overall export time length, which might improve the vessels’ turnover and reduce the corresponding operational costs, and supported the potential re-design of performance indicators in process control and monitoring. The results answer the above-mentioned calls and they offer a valuable, analytics-based alternative to the extant approaches for improving port performance, because it focuses on the port information flow, which is often related to sustainability issues, rather than the physical one.","https://www.proquest.com/docview/2541313969?accountid=44943&bdid=84593&_bd=avltf%2BtbLj8zCWuJ2r8ZihXGQI0%3D","https://doi.org/10.3390/su11164473"

Typically, UAVs equipped with cameras collect data from disaster areas and transmit it to the shore-based rescue command centers. By deploying Mobile Edge Computing (MEC) servers, UAVs can pre-process video footage to reduce data transmission volume, thus reducing transmission delays. However, the limited computational capacity and energy of UAVs pose significant challenges to the efficiency of UAV-assisted MSAR systems. To address these problems, in this paper, we investigate a multi-UAV assisted MSAR system consisting of multiple Surveillance UAVs (S-UAVs) and a Relay UAV (R-UAV). Then, we formulate a joint optimization problem to minimize the maximum total latency among all S-UAVs via jointly making the computing offloading decisions, R-UAV deployment, and the association between a S-UAV and rescue targets while ensuring that all targets are monitored by S-UAVs. Since the formulated optimization problem is typically hard to solve due to its non-convexity, we propose an effective iterative algorithm by breaking it into three sub-problems. Numerical simulation results show the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm with various performance parameters.","https://www.proquest.com/docview/3106500329?accountid=44943&bdid=84593&_bd=a3TbkOd%2FAYEpdHyi9VZ5E6%2BxYCM%3D","https://doi.org/10.1109/TVT.2024.3384570"

There is much research on this topic, but there have been few studies on the relationship between ship deficiencies and ship detention decisions using unsupervised machine learning artificial intelligence techniques. Although the previous methods or models are feasible for ship detention decisions, they all have shortcomings to some extent, such as large training model errors caused by the imbalance of class labels in the dataset and the fact that the training model cannot comprehensively consider all factors influencing ship detention decision due to the complexity and diversity of the problem.

In this paper, we apply state-of-the-art deep reinforcement learning algorithms to automate these operations in a complex and real environment. The objective is to teach an autonomous tug master to manage rolling cargo and perform loading and unloading operations while avoiding collisions with static and dynamic obstacles along the way. The artificial intelligence agent, representing the tug master, is trained and evaluated in a challenging environment based on the Unity3D learning framework, called the ML-Agents, and using proximal policy optimization. The agent is equipped with sensors for obstacle detection and is provided with real-time feedback from the environment thanks to its own reward function, allowing it to dynamically adapt its policies and navigation strategy. The performance evaluation shows that by choosing appropriate hyperparameters, the agents can successfully learn all required operations including lane-following, obstacle avoidance, and rolling cargo placement. This study also demonstrates the potential of intelligent autonomous systems to improve the performance and service quality of maritime transport.","https://www.proquest.com/docview/2489030848?accountid=44943&bdid=84593&_bd=KjPsqlgY7FdY0xpkel%2F6e%2B2Heww%3D","https://doi.org/10.3390/logistics5010010"

In particular, the rapid development of sensor technologies enables multisource data collection to improve the modeling of the SFC problem. To address the features of such heterogeneous data, this paper proposes an integrated model for the estimation of SFC that includes three modules: a multisource data collection module, a heterogeneous data feature fusion module and a fuel consumption estimation module. First, in the data collection module, data related to SFC are collected by multiple sensors installed aboard the ship. Second, the feature fusion module employs a series of moving overlapped frames to merge different frequency data into small frames so that fusion features can be extracted from the heterogeneous data of multiple sources. Finally, in the fuel estimation module, the fusion features provide a novel way to consider the modeling and estimation of SFC as a classical time-series analysis using various machine learning techniques. Experimentally, linear regression (LR), support vector regression (SVR), and artificial neural network (ANN) were employed as the machine learning methods to train SFC models. Compared with the traditional feature extraction method, the accuracy of LR, SVR, and ANN were improved by 8.5, 0.35 and 51.5%, respectively, using the proposed method. The main contribution of this work is to consider the multisource and heterogeneous problem of sensor-based SFC data and propose an integrated model to extract the information of SFC data. Moreover, the experimental results showed that the estimation accuracy can be greatly improved.","https://www.proquest.com/docview/2498711233?accountid=44943&bdid=84593&_bd=YUeeHfuY8bE53uWwVn6q%2BjCZ06g%3D","https://doi.org/10.3390/jmse9030273"

Optimization of the energy system (especially propulsion system) in these vessels is a complex multi-objective challenge involving economical maintenance, environmental metrics, and energy demand requirements. In this paper, data from instrumented vessels on the River Thames in London, which includes environmental emissions, power demands, journey patterns, and variance in operational patterns from the captain(s) and loading (passenger numbers), is integrated and analyzed through automatic, multi-objective global optimization to create an optimal hybrid propulsion configuration for a hybrid vessel. We propose and analyze a number of computational techniques, both for monitoring and remaining useful lifetime (RUL) estimation of individual energy assets, as well as modeling and optimization of energy use scenarios of a hybrid-powered vessel. Our multi-objective optimization relates to emissions, asset health, and power performance. We show that, irrespective of the battery packs used, our Relevance Vector Machine (RVM) algorithm is able to achieve over 92% accuracy in remaining useful life (RUL) predictions. A k-nearest neighbors algorithm (KNN) is proposed for prognostics of state of charge (SOC) of back-up lead-acid batteries. The classifier achieved an average of 95.5% accuracy in a three-fold cross validation. Utilizing operational data from the vessel, optimal autonomous propulsion strategies are modeled combining the use of battery and diesel engines. The experiment results show that 70% to 80% of fuel saving can be achieved when the diesel engine is operated up to 350 kW.

We present insights from a highly influential paper. Here are the highlights from this paper: The deployment of mega container ships with a capacity for 18,000 + TEU on major trade lanes is a recent trend within the ocean shipping industry. Larger ships pose multiple challenges to ports and hinterland connections as well as to the beneficial cargo owners. To achieve maximum utilization of their larger vessels, carriers have entered cooperative global alliances on predetermined routes, resulting in new discharge patterns at U.S. ports. These multi-partner networks involve several competing firms which voluntarily and interactively engage in service delivery. Container carriage is increasingly competitive, and requires continuing cost reductions. There is increasing evidence, however, that cargo shippers are less satisfied with the service their supply chains are receiving. Standardizing process performance through supply chain integration and removing inefficiency will be needed to stabilize the international shipping market, but the question remains how ocean carriers will be able to differentiate themselves and create improved supply chain performance. This paper suggests an answer through a simple standard performance measurement model. We will suggest that old systems of carrier competition could evolve to greater cooperation and coordination between business competitors, a state sometimes called ""coopetition"", by development of standard setting processes for sharing information while retaining specific service delivery structures to provide differentiated value to customers.

The oceanic tropospheric duct is much more complicated than the atmospheric structure on land due to the rough sea surface influence, and it leads to difficulties in loss prediction. Classical radio wave propagation loss prediction models are either based on complicated electromagnetic wave theories or rely on empirical data. Consequently, they suffer from low accuracy and a limited range of application. To address this issue, a novel maritime propagation loss prediction approach is proposed, which fully exploits the data for training. In this new approach, 3D sea surface contour profiles are generated based on the Pierson–Moskowitz spectrum theory and the direction expansion formula Stereo Wave Observation Program (SWOP), by sweeping the parameters. The full-wave propagation procedure of radio signals over the sea surface is simulated by commercial EM analysis software CST Studio Suite. Based on the large quantity of simulated data, the BP neural network is employed to fit the radio propagation loss and obtain the sea surface radio wave propagation prediction model. Other classical machine learning methods are also compared to validate the proposed approach. Traditional empirical model construction relies on observation data. This approach, for the first time, proposed an automatic scheme which covers the whole procedure from the data generation to prediction model training. It avoids the requirements for on-site observation, as well as significantly decreases the cost of experiments. The application scope of the prediction model such as propagation distance range and working frequency range could be adaptive through adjustments for simulated sea size and simulated working frequency. This approach is validated to save 99% of prediction time in comparison with the full-wave simulations. The prediction model trained via our proposed method could obtain the coefficient of determination R2 which is over 0.92, demonstrating the superiority of this method.","https://www.proquest.com/docview/2724304386?accountid=44943&bdid=84593&_bd=d9ZPqiPle1syT4ZVV8%2FlGZYnXdQ%3D","https://doi.org/10.3390/rs14194753"

This investigation suggests that the method proposed can improve the safety and operation of ship-to-shore vessel traffic management.","https://www.proquest.com/docview/2287335873?accountid=44943&bdid=84593&_bd=iAf8aWuSB%2Fvd%2FP5vMyHXxz2%2FQwI%3D","https://doi.org/10.2112/SI91-082.1"

The major challenges are related with the way to extract insights from such a rich data environment and whether Deep Learning can be successful with Big Data. To get some insight on these topics, social network data are employed as a case study on how sentiments can affect decisions in stock market environments. In this paper, we propose a generalized Deep Learning-based classification framework for Stock Market Sentiment Analysis. This work comprises the study, the development, and implementation of an automatic classification system based on Deep Learning and the validation of its adequacy and efficiency in any scenario, particularly Stock Market Sentiment Analysis. Distinct datasets and several Deep Learning approaches with different layers and embedded techniques are used, and their performances are evaluated. These developments show how Deep Learning reacts to distinct contexts. The results also give context on how different techniques with different parameter combinations react to certain types of data. Convolution obtained the best results when dealing with complex data inputs, and long short-term layers kept a memory of data, allowing inputs which are not as common to still be considered for decisions. The models that resulted from Stock Market Sentiment Analysis datasets were applied with some success to real-life problems. The best models reached accuracies of 73% in training and 69% in certain test datasets. In a simulation, a model was able to provide a Return on Investment of 4.4%.

Air pollution in ports is caused by exhaust gases from various elements, including ships, and to reduce this, the International Maritime Organization (IMO) is also making efforts to reduce air pollution by regulating the sulfur content of fuel used by ships. Nevertheless, there is a lack of measures to identify and minimize the effects of air pollution. The Community Multiscale Air Quality (CMAQ) model is the most used to understand the effects of air pollution. In this paper, we propose a hybrid model combining the CMAQ model and RNN-LSTM, an artificial neural network model. Since the RNN-LSTM model has very good predictive performance, combining these two models can improve the spatial distribution prediction performance of a large area at a relatively low cost. In fact, as a result of prediction using the hybrid model, it was found that IOA improved by 0.235~0.317 and RMSE decreased by 4.82~8.50 μg/m3 compared to the case of using only CMAQ. This means that when PM2.5 is predicted using the hybrid model, the accuracy of the spatial distribution of PM2.5 can be improved. In the future, if real-time prediction is performed using the hybrid model, the accuracy of the calculation of exposure to air pollutants can be increased, which can help evaluate the impact on health. Ultimately, it is expected to help reduce the damage caused by air pollution through accurate predictions of air pollution.","https://www.proquest.com/docview/2716488680?accountid=44943&bdid=84593&_bd=23PEiNgBiPc%2BPjLCpz7WonvENE8%3D","https://doi.org/10.3390/atmos13091462"

It provides greater access to Arctic resources such as oil and gas. As global warming accelerates, melting Arctic ice caps are likely to increase traffic in the NSR and enhance its commercial viability. Due to the harsh Arctic environment imposing threats to the safety of ship navigation, it is necessary to assess Arctic navigation risk to maintain shipping safety. Currently, most studies are focused on the conventional assessment of the risk, which lacks the validation based on actual data. In this study, actual data about Arctic navigation environment and related expert judgments were used to generate a structured data set. Based on the structured data set, extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost) and alternative methods were used to establish models for the assessment of Arctic navigation risk, which were validated using cross‐validation. The results show that compared with alternative models, XGBoost models have the best performance in terms of mean absolute errors and root mean squared errors. The XGBoost models can learn and reproduce expert judgments and knowledge for the assessment of Arctic navigation risk. Feature importance (FI) and shapley additive explanations (SHAP) are used to further interpret the relationship between input data and predictions. The application of XGBoost, FI, and SHAP is aimed to improve the safety of Arctic shipping using advanced artificial intelligence techniques.

Previous studies have shown that vibration emissions have a negative effect on spermatozoa, however, there has been no documentation of the vibrations spermatozoa are exposed to during transport. To answer this question, several breeding companies worldwide were interviewed about their delivery process. As it turns out, environmental influences are only rarely recorded, and vibrations are not monitored at all. To record and to evaluate vibrations that occur during transport, we have developed a measurement system and investigated vibration intensities in standardized road trials. We were able to show that both speed and road surface significantly influence the produced vibrations. Furthermore, the occurrence of the vibrations on a reference delivery from a German boar stud was studied. In the future, it is recommended that in order to avoid negative influences during transport, the transport of boar semen should be permanently monitored.AbstractIn the modern pig reproduction system, artificial insemination (AI) doses are delivered from AI centers to sow farms via logistics vehicles. In this study, six breeding companies in three countries (Brazil, Germany, and the USA) were interviewed about their delivery process. It was found that there is currently no comprehensive monitoring system for the delivery of semen. The entire process “shipping of boar semen” was documented using Business Process Model and Notation (BPMN). Although it is not currently known which vibrations occur at all, it is suspected that vibration emissions affect the quality of boar semen. For this reason, a prototype of a measuring system was developed to calculate a displacement index (Di), representing vibration intensities. Vibrations were analyzed in standardized road trials (n = 120) on several road types (A: smooth asphalt pavement, B: rough asphalt pavement, C: cobblestone, and D: dirt road) with different speeds (30, 60, 90, 120, and 150 km/h). A two-way ANOVA showed significant differences in mean Di, depending on road surface and speed as well as an interaction of both factors (p< 0.001). A field study on a reference delivery from a German AI center to several sow farms indicated that 33% of the observed roads are in good quality and generate only a few vibrations (Di ≤ 1), while 40% are of a moderate quality with interrupted surfaces (Di = 1–1.5). However, 25% of the roads show markedly increased vibrations (Di ≥ 1.5), as a consequence of bad conditions on cobblestones or unpaved roads. Overall, more attention should be paid to factors affecting sperm quality during transport. In the future, an Internet of Things (IoT) based solution could enable complete monitoring of the entire transport process in real time, which could influence the courier’s driving behavior based on road conditions in order to maintain the quality of the transported AI doses.","https://www.proquest.com/docview/2670049680?accountid=44943&bdid=84593&_bd=0Mhn6hReKN9bguJ9uFoH0D5BEHM%3D","https://doi.org/10.3390/ani12101331"

The goal of the model was not to obtain a better solution but rather to closely match a number of operational statistics. In addition to the need to capture a wide range of operational issues, the model had to match the performance of a highly skilled group of dispatchers while also returning the marginal value of drivers domiciled at different locations. These requirements dictated that it was not enough to optimize at each point in time (something that could be easily handled by a simulation model) but also over time. The project required bringing together years of research in approximate dynamic programming, merging math programming with machine learning, to solve dynamic programs with extremely high-dimensional state variables.

Predicting the composition of exhaust gases emitted by ship engines will be of consequence in this respect. Therefore, in this study, exhaust gas data were collected from the generator engine of a real ship along with engine-related data to predict emission characteristics. This is because installing an emission gas analyzer on a ship has substantial economic burden, and, even if it is installed, the accuracy can be increased by a virtual sensor. Furthermore, data were obtained with and without operating the SCR (often mounted on ships to reduce NOx), which is a crucial facility to satisfy environment regulation. In this study, four types of datasets were created by adding cooling and electrical-related variables to the basic engine dataset to check whether it improves model performance or not; each of these datasets consisted of 15 to 26 variables as inputs. CO2 (%), NOx (ppm), and tEx (°C) were predicted from each dataset using an artificial neural network (ANN) model and a support vector machine (SVM) model with optimal hyperparameters selected by trial and error. The results confirmed that the SVM model performed better on smaller datasets, such as the one used in this study compared to the ANN model. Moreover, the dataset type, DaCE, which had both cooling and electrical-related variables added to the basic engine dataset, yielded the best overall prediction performance. When the performance of the SVM model was measured using the test data of a DaCE on both no-SCR mode and SCR mode, the RMSE (R2) of CO2 was between 0.1137% (0.8119) and 0.0912% (0.8975), the RMSE (R2) of NOx was between 17.1088 ppm (0.9643) and 13.6775 ppm (0.9776), and the RMSE (R2) of tEx was between 4.5839 °C (0.8754) and 1.5688 °C (0.9392).","https://www.proquest.com/docview/2706220676?accountid=44943&bdid=84593&_bd=RW75PFUsowsOeMQypgPdLPQcBJw%3D","https://doi.org/10.3390/jmse10081118"

With the continuous improvement of autonomy, the increasing complexity of tasks, and the emergence of various types of advanced sensors, higher requirements are imposed on the computing performance of USV clusters, especially for latency sensitive tasks. However, during the execution of marine operations, due to the relative movement of the USV cluster nodes and the network topology of the cluster, the wireless channel states are changing rapidly, and the computing resources of cluster nodes may be available or unavailable at any time. It is difficult to accurately predict in advance. Therefore, we propose an optimized offloading mechanism based on the classic multi-armed bandit (MAB) theory. This mechanism enables USV cluster nodes to dynamically make offloading decisions by learning the potential computing performance of their neighboring team nodes to minimize average computation task offloading delay. It is an optimized algorithm named Adaptive Upper Confidence Boundary (AUCB) algorithm, and corresponding simulations are designed to evaluate the performance. The algorithm enables the USV cluster to effectively adapt to the marine vehicular fog computing networks, balancing the trade-off between exploration and exploitation (EE).

These impacts are deeply intertwined as the majority of Mediterranean Sea introductions are ship-facilitated. Here we analyzed shipping data for the Canal between 2011–2018, and characterized the shipping trends of the Canal in relation to global shipping trends and to the introduction of NIS. We differentiated the data analysis between ballast-weighted ships and cargo laden ships according to nine ship categories: Tankers, LNG (Liquid Natural Gas) Ships, Bulk Carriers, General Cargo, Container Ships, Ro/Ro (Roll on/ off) ships, Car-Carriers, Passenger Ships, and Others. We used statistical tests to determine whether the August 2015 expansion influenced shipping trends and discuss our findings with respect to patterns in species introductions. Our findings show that although there has been an increase in tonnage being shipped through the Canal, this is a consequence of an increase in ship dimensions, while the actual number of ships for some categories has decreased. This pattern was particularly evident in the container ship category, which had the highest global growth compared to other ship categories. A few categories, such as bulk carriers and tankers, had more traffic in particular directions of passage. Only passenger ships and bulk carriers revealed significant seasonal transit trends, with higher transfers during spring and autumn for passenger ships and summer/autumn for bulk carriers. An increase in average ship size was evident for almost all categories. Larger ships imply a longer turnover time spent in ports and a larger available wetted surface area that is susceptible to fouling, thus potentially providing a larger fouling community with more time to propagate and settle in a novel habitat. Our findings emphasize the importance of identifying current shipping trends that may pose a threat to the Mediterranean Sea biodiversity in order to construct a follow-on policy to mitigate the transfer and delivery of NIS via the Suez Canal. Specifically, enforcement of antifouling regulations is highlighted as a significant contribution to the European Union Marine Strategy Framework Directive goals to achieve a good environmental status.","https://www.proquest.com/docview/2439527233?accountid=44943&bdid=84593&_bd=Myh3O%2FI%2BKhj4J40g9w%2FRAwuTdcA%3D",""

Neural networks (NNs), the most common algorithms for implementing deep learning, are known not to have a relative advantage in handling structured data, particularly in processing categorical data. The inefficiency of NNs for processing categorical data significantly degrades their performance when categorical data occupy a significant portion of a dataset. In this study, we employed a NN to estimate second-hand ship prices. Its architecture was specified using entity embedding layers to enhance the performance of the network when categorical variables were highly cardinal. Experimental results demonstrated that the information contained in categorical data can be efficiently extracted and fed into a NN using the entity embedding technique, thereby improving the prediction accuracy for ship valuation.

It did so by developing a method for building metadata through a data chain, mining this metadata and representing it in such a way that a consumer of the data can judge the integrity of the data and factor this into the decision-making aspect of their response. This research proposes a design, implementation and evaluation of a safety data model that helps to ensure integrity of data use for data analysis and decision making to prevent loss of lives and properties. Modern and sophisticated ETL software tools including Microsoft SQL Server 2012 Data Tools and Microsoft SQL Server Management Studio were explored. The data were extracted from Safety Related Condition Reports (SRCRs) dataset and used data mining techniques to transform and filter unsafe and hazardous data from the extracted data and stored the safe data into the Data Warehouses (DWs). The prototype was able to load data into designated DWs. The success of the developed model proved that the prototype was able to extract all datasets, transform and load data into the DWs and moved extracted files to archive folder within 7.406 seconds.","https://www.proquest.com/docview/1986621167?accountid=44943&bdid=84593&_bd=QoI9gZuLodhmu%2BJxc8Ge5LufMNo%3D","https://doi.org/10.5815/ijieeb.2017.04.04"

The life cycle of apparel products has contracted and is now, generally, a several-week season, during which time a majority of products are supposed to be sold. Products that do not sell well may be sold at a price lower than the fixed price, and products that do not sell at all within the sales period may eventually become forced disposal. This creates long-term management and environmental problems. In practice, shipping personnel determine when to ship products to stores after reviewing product sales information. However, they may not schedule or structure these shipments properly because they cannot effectively monitor sales for a large number of products. In this paper, shipment is considered to reduce the risk of product disposal on the premise of selling at a fixed price. Although shipment quantities are determined by various factors, we only consider the change in inventory at the logistics warehouse, since it is difficult to incorporate all factors into the analysis. From cluster analysis, it is found that shipping personnel should recognize a policy to sell products gradually over time. Furthermore, to reduce the risk of disposal, we forecast the inventory from conditional probability and are able to extract products out of a standard grouping using past data.","https://www.proquest.com/docview/2533158467?accountid=44943&bdid=84593&_bd=KW0xXGJjKiANh904l6nZ91BQVak%3D","https://doi.org/10.3390/su11010259"

Both the cost efficiency and timeliness of shipping service can be improved through the use of this method.  The economic trade-offs between the investments in cargo handling and ship propulsion technologies are formally analyzed by taking the round trip frequency as the key to performance.

The technology exists but in order to embrace it to bring about safer seas, current legislation and practices need to be reviewed to provide comfort and clarity for dynamic transformation to take place. This paper provides a comprehensive study of the current collision regulations and humbly suggests some revisions to ensure safe intelligent navigation. Collision avoidance is not about a ship meeting another ship with the actions regulated. Realistically, the navigator is faced with a multitude of ships and situations where the risk of collision may exist with several vessels needing to take avoiding action or requiring to maintain course and speed as dictated by the current rules. SMART technology can provide speedy and reliable computed actions to assist the navigator, reducing human error or the widely differing actions that might be taken by individual humans. Ultimately, unmanned ships may be the future of shipping as eradicating human error is only possible if the human is removed. Collating measurable effective actions from reputed ship masters for a multitude of collision scenarios and programming them into an artificial intelligence system, will provide stable and predictable collision avoidance actions that can be shared on inclusive platforms with other ships in the vicinity. This removes the varied action of humans and synchronizes manned vessels with MASS providing accurate predictive movements and big data computation. It is timely that the current collision regulations are reviewed and complications addressed to render clarity and simplicity with MASS treated no different. As we harmonize technology and humans with a defined regulatory framework that embraces both, only then can the desired goals become a reality.","https://www.proquest.com/docview/2568478212?accountid=44943&bdid=84593&_bd=KZFmqELcrfIbuRgSKefUKTbztSA%3D","https://doi.org/10.1088/1742-6596/1357/1/012011"

As an explainable AI method, this study adopts Shapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP), which is theoretically solid and compatible with any kind of machine learning algorithm. SHAP enables us to measure the marginal contribution of each sensor variable to an anomaly. Thus, one can easily specify which sensor is responsible for the specific anomaly. To illustrate our framework, the actual sensor stream obtained from the cargo vessel collected over 10 months was analyzed. In this analysis, we performed hierarchical clustering analysis with transformed SHAP values to interpret and group common anomaly patterns. We showed that anomaly interpretation and segmentation using SHAP value provides more useful interpretation compared to the case without using SHAP value.","https://www.proquest.com/docview/2558928349?accountid=44943&bdid=84593&_bd=AwKPJ1olwBJMtnot5lTPmzf%2BYvM%3D","https://doi.org/10.3390/s21155200"

To enable diverse AI applications, numerous computation-intensive tasks (e.g., image recognition, video processing, path planning, etc.) that cannot be locally executed by UAVs need to be timely and effectively offloaded. Multiple unmanned surface vehicles (USVs) integrated into a USV fleet is appealingly advocated to provide abundant computation resources for computation tasks. In this paper, we propose an energy-efficient USV fleets-assisted collaborative computation offloading scheme for smart maritime services. Specifically, we first propose a collaborative computation offloading framework, where UAVs act as the requesters of computation offloading services, and USV fleets are the helpers. Then, the first-price sealed reverse auction with reserve price is utilized to incentivize USV fleets to assist in executing computation tasks of UAVs, where the reserve price guarantees the satisfied benefits of UAVs. Afterwards, to minimize the energy consumption of executing tasks within the USV fleet under the delay constraint, the joint allocation optimization scheme for computation subtasks and computation capacities is proposed based on the Block Coordinate Descent (BCD) and Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM). Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed scheme improves the expected revenue and participation degree of the USV fleet and reduces the overall energy consumption of computation offloading compared to conventional schemes.","https://www.proquest.com/docview/3117131296?accountid=44943&bdid=84593&_bd=%2BvGV3EXVjccPz5VT4VQOR0VMN7Y%3D","https://doi.org/10.1109/TVT.2024.3359310"

Due to the academic and business importance of this problem, it has attracted the attention of machine learning enthusiasts. There are several complexities and challenges in the automated parsing of invoices.

This problem can be solved by the automatic traversal of the invoices by object detection algorithms such as YOLO, SSD and R-CNN. These state-of-the-art algorithms will be trained to detect various fields or entities present in an invoice. In this paper, a dataset of 315 invoices has been generated using web testing tools. The dataset has been annotated for eight entities: billing address, shipping address, invoice date, invoice number, product name, price, quantity, and total amount. The text boxes detected by the models is converted to machine encoded text, using text extraction methods such as Optical Character Recognition (OCR). Hyperparameter tuning has been performed to improve model accuracy. The models have been evaluated on myriad metrics such as mean Average Precision (mAP), common objects in context (COCO) evaluation metrics and total loss during training and validation.

Furthermore, they created a model of comanagement of major seaports and presented a qualitative and quantitative comparison of the development of major seaports from 2005 to 2019. It was discovered that port turnover increased, but in various ways in each of the analysed ports. The government of Poland, acting in a dual role as the coordinator of national maritime policy and the majority owner of seaports, was the most powerful decision-maker in the port economy.

This situation will continue in the future with GPS, possibly together with other Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS) e.g. Galileo, being the core PNT technology for e-Navigation - the future digital maritime architecture. GPS signals, measured at the surface on the Earth, are very weak. As such, the system is vulnerable to unintentional interference and jamming, resulting in possible denial of service over large geographical areas. The result of such interference could be the complete failure of the mariner's GPS receiver or, possibly worse, the presentation to the mariner of hazardously misleading information (HMI) for navigation and situational awareness, depending on how the GPS receiver reacts to the jamming incident. Recognising this, the General Lighthouse Authorities of the United Kingdom and Ireland (GLA), in collaboration with the UK Ministry of Defence (MOD) Defence Science and Technology Laboratory (DSTL), have conducted a series of sea-trials with the aim of identifying the full effects of GPS jamming on safe navigation at sea.This paper presents the key findings of these trials and provides important information on the effect of GPS denial. The GLA are playing a pivotal role in the establishment of eLoran as an independent source of PNT, taking advantage of eLoran's complementary nature, having dissimilar failure modes to GPS and the future GNSS.

We show that a new kind of seafaring is emerging, characterized by cooperation with AI systems. In this format of seafaring, navigation tasks are controlled automatically while human operators manage the automation, always “in the loop” and ready to take over control if necessary. Ideally, this arrangement sees improvements in overall system performance and safety. However, little is known today about how this format of work will unfold in real-world operations. We investigate this topic by interviewing operators (n = 5) on ferries recently outfitted with state-of-the-art automated navigation technology. We used a mixed-methods approach to analyze the case study interviews, combining quantitative text analysis with Grounded Theory qualitative analysis techniques. The results show that operators perceived a shift towards a backup role coincident with increasing agency of machine autonomy. This role shift was characterized by “button-pressing” to start the machine autonomy and subsequently intervening to stop it when things go wrong. We observed that this shift led to boredom, deskilling, stretched resources, and compromised organizational harmony – effects running counter to the intention of improved system performance and safety. Synthesizing the findings, we present (1) effects across three operational dimensions: (i) tasks, (ii) human-computer interaction, (iii) organization; and (2) a definition of collaborative (human-AI) seafaring. By identifying issues in the early implementation of highly automated ship navigation, we hope to guide designers of Maritime Autonomous Surface Ships (MASSs) away from potential pitfalls and towards development more in tune with real-world demands of collaborative work.","https://www.proquest.com/docview/2698677084?accountid=44943&bdid=84593&_bd=ien6r3a9wwGu2vC5wMiD8%2FmBq%2FQ%3D","https://doi.org/10.1088/1742-6596/2311/1/012028"

Therefore, it turns out to be a valuable enabling technology within a considerable number of applications. Apart from traditional remote monitoring and data acquisition purposes where comparable Low Power Wide Area Network (LPWAN) facilities have ruled for years, NB-IoT can potentially carve out space within specific alcoves in which low latency, low power, high data-rates and ubiquitous coverage are fundamentals requirements. Long term asset tracking definitely falls within such niches, and in particular NB-IoT can become a valuable alternative to be exploited by both replacing the conventional Global Position System (GPS) system, or supporting it. To this end, this paper proposes an innovative tracking system prototype for asset shipping which relies on two enabling technologies: GPS and NB-IoT. While position transmission is always put into effect via NB-IoT, it can be fetched by resorting to both GPS (like a standard tracker) or NB-IoT (thus establishing a GPS-less method). As a result, two localization techniques are arranged: the former one is preciser but energy hungrier, while the latter one is coarser but more low power. Such working principles were successfully tested on the field by means of two road tests in as much itineraries. Tests results are in agreement with the expectations underlying the two working principles since the finer one provides a more accurate tracking. In addition, a consumption analysis was also performed aiming at assessing the prototype lifetime. Finally, tests pursuing the assessment of the tracking error were carried out underling the fact that it strongly depends on the geographic deployment of NB-IoT towers.","https://www.proquest.com/docview/2539981262?accountid=44943&bdid=84593&_bd=8%2Bjx3FHQz4bKcvDK34ASkVmuTWA%3D","https://doi.org/10.3390/s21113772"

The aim of this paper is to examine the ability of FFAs to improve forecasting accuracy. We use two different dynamic ANN models, NARNET and NARXNET, and we compare their performance for 1, 2, 3 and 6 months ahead. The accuracy of the forecasting models is evaluated with the use of mean squared error (MSE), based on actual secondary data including historical Baltic Panamax Index (BPI) data (available online), and primary data on Baltic forward assessment (BFA) collected from the Baltic Exchange. The experimental results show that, in general, NARXNET outperforms NARNET in all forecast horizons, revealing the importance of the information contained in FFAs in improving forecasting accuracy.

It is of utmost importance that the various chain actors are well aligned with each other, so as to make transport operations as smooth as possible, ideally also without Estimated Time of Arrival (ETA) deviations. To examine which parameters have to be tackled primarily so as to reduce ETA deviations, this paper examines for each individual ship type at the port of Antwerp which parameters significantly influence ETA deviations. First and foremost, it is observed that seagoing vessels exhibit significantly greater deviations than inland vessels. We also find that chemtankers do not appear to be significantly influenced by their dimensions and geographic parameters. Container ships, on the other hand, are insensitive to both geographical and meteorological parameters. General tankers, on the other hand, show the greatest deviations. The output of the synthesizing Principal Component Analysis indicates that for all ship types the dimensions and meteorological parameters have the greatest explanatory power in the context of deviation predictions. The equations developed on this basis are able to calculate the chance of ETA deviations for each vessel type in the dataset. This result is therefore of great relevance to all actors in the maritime supply chains, as it allows planning much better and avoiding unnecessary asset and staff expenses.","https://www.proquest.com/docview/3098773998?accountid=44943&bdid=84593&_bd=RUQ3vdPQFrLuCLL5hhDoeuQEo3o%3D","https://doi.org/10.1007/s13437-024-00341-w"

To help anticipate and address issues that may arise in the move to autonomous maritime operations, this research applies a human-centered approach to developing decision support technology, specifically in the context of ice management operations. New technologies, such as training simulators and onboard decision support systems, present opportunities to close the gaps in competence and proficiency. Training simulators, for example, are useful platforms as human behaviour laboratories to capture expert knowledge and test training interventions. The information gathered from simulators can be integrated into a decision support system to provide seafarers with onboard guidance in real time. The purpose of this research is two-fold: (1) to capture knowledge held by expert seafarers, and (2) transform this expert knowledge into a database for the development of a decision support technology. This paper demonstrates the use of semi-structured interviews and bridge simulator exercises as a means to capture seafarer experience and best operating practices for offshore ice management. A case-based reasoning (CBR) model is used to translate the results of the knowledge capture exercises into an early-stage ice management decision support system. This paper will describe the methods used and insights gained from translating the interview data and expert performance from the bridge simulator into a case base that can be referenced by the CBR model.","https://www.proquest.com/docview/2441907439?accountid=44943&bdid=84593&_bd=Ve2klJoLwJyDsswrs%2BB1VVd1ehU%3D","https://doi.org/10.3390/jmse8090689"

The purpose of the paper is to investigate whether the introduction of Automated Straddle Carriers in port operations can improve the overall efficiency. To achieve the objective, a System Dynamics model was developed and tested under different scenarios. The results indicate that the introduction of ASCs is accompanied by an increase in productivity of the vehicles which results in more TEUs serviced. One of the most interesting results of the various scenarios is that for all rates of incoming TEUs, berth productivity is superior when operations are performed with 5 ASCs than with 10 manned vehicles. Finally, another issue that port authorities should always have in mind is the need for coordination among the various sub-processes and optimization of the necessary vehicles in order to avoid under-utilization of resources.","https://www.proquest.com/docview/2615869806?accountid=44943&bdid=84593&_bd=Ds%2F7AGGZdZX1u%2FlBIrmE2tZ2vhY%3D","https://doi.org/10.3311/PPtr.15527"

Considered one of the machine learning algorithms that has received considerable attention, reinforcement learning technology enables actions to be continually optimized by agents interacting with the environment, aiming to maximize rewards and returns. Significant potential is attributed to the research on autonomous ship collision avoidance. To investigate an efficient and practical ship collision avoidance algorithm, the knowledge transfer (KT) method is employed in this research to introduce an improved reinforcement learning approach. With a thorough understanding of ship collision avoidance behavior and the Convention on the International Regulations for Preventing Collisions at Sea (COLREGs), a reward function is designed to guide and constrain ship collision avoidance behavior. Subsequently, ship collision avoidance tasks are categorized, and knowledge from source tasks is extracted and transferred to closely related target tasks. Experiments have been conducted across various collision avoidance tasks, encompassing diverse types and degrees of similarity. In multi-ships cases, the success rate of the learned knowledge applications of head-on, overtaking, and crossing encounter cases are 90%, 95%, and 82.5% respectively. The outcomes demonstrate that the proposed method enhances algorithmic efficiency while satisfying the requirements for safety and rule compliance in ship collision avoidance behavior.

This work is intended to apply a new methodology to the field of underwater archaeology. Shipwrecks represent a major resource to understand maritime human activity over millennia, but underwater archaeology is expensive, misappropriated, and hazardous. An automated tool to rapidly detect and map shipwrecks can therefore be used to create more accurate maps of natural and archaeological features to aid management objectives, study patterns across the landscape, and find new features. Additionally, more comprehensive and accurate shipwreck maps can help to prioritize site selection and plan excavation. The model is based on open source topo-bathymetric data and shipwreck data for the United States available from NOAA. The model uses transfer learning to compensate for a relatively small sample size and addresses a recurring problem that associated work has had with false positives by training the model both on shipwrecks and background topography. Results of statistical analyses conducted—ANOVAs and box and whisker plots—indicate that there are substantial differences between the morphologic characteristics that define shipwrecks vs. background topography, supporting this approach to addressing false positives. The model uses a YOLOv3 architecture and produced an F1 score of 0.92 and a precision score of 0.90, indicating that the approach taken herein to address false positives was successful.","https://www.proquest.com/docview/2530133205?accountid=44943&bdid=84593&_bd=sLJITF%2BjP3FA9eNYgUQc2q7MtfY%3D","https://doi.org/10.3390/rs13091759"

First, the attributes of the blips in the sequential radar images, such as speed, direction and size, are quantified as three pieces of evidence to determine whether a radar blip is a moving vessel. Then, an artificial intelligence was built based on FCM. According to the three pieces of evidence, the possibility of a blip being a real vessel is computed with FCM. The main difficulty in building the FCM framework is to find an appropriate way to provide the classification coefficient C and the fuzzy coefficient m. Since the C in classification is finite, this study proposes a method to obtain C by assessing the Euclidean distance of the expected result. Since m is related to the discreteness of evidence and results, the coefficient can be assessed by Shannon entropy and gain. Field experiments suggest that the improved FCM is capable of classifying the radar blips accurately, and reducing the operational strength of the ship operators and improving the safety.","https://www.proquest.com/docview/2786532181?accountid=44943&bdid=84593&_bd=PBO3nDEOtk4y74Pk12jcTkDf6KY%3D","https://doi.org/10.12973/eurasia.2017.01048a"

As a result, our oceans have been severely affected due to climate change and global warming. To address this issue, this study investigates the factors that cause ocean CO2 using a sample of 44 countries over 2012–2021 and explores a dynamic and causal relationship between economic growth, ocean carbon dioxide emissions, energy consumption, and control variables relating to the ocean industry. This study finds that increasing economic activity tends to increase ocean carbon emissions. The results support the evidence of the environmental Kuznets curve (EKC) hypothesis suggesting an inverted U-shaped association between ocean emissions and real income for the sample countries. Moreover, this study reports that ocean health index, maritime container transport, trade of fishery and ocean species, aquaculture production and marine species, and employment rate in the fishery processing sector are the significant factors of ocean CO2. Region-wise analyses suggest that real income positively influences ocean emissions and confirm the evidence of the EKC hypothesis in European sample countries but these relationships have an insignificant effect in Asia and the Pacific and the American regions. Furthermore, a short-run unidirectional panel causality flows from the production of aquaculture and other species to RD&D, from OHI and GDP to trade of fishery and other species, and from OHI to employment rate in the fishery sector. Likewise, bidirectional causality runs from energy consumption and maritime transport to ocean CO2 in the long term. Regarding the long-run causal association, the results determine that all of the estimated coefficients of the lagged error correction terms are statistically significant which explains that they are crucial in the adjustment process as they deviate from the long-run equilibrium.","https://www.proquest.com/docview/2904813653?accountid=44943&bdid=84593&_bd=wgZsBUmy6z4jeyVUYsVzHuC2JfA%3D","https://doi.org/10.1007/s11356-023-30880-3"

Establishing a cooperative collision avoidance (CA) path for multi-ship encounters is of great value to maritime intelligent transportation. This study aims to solve the problem of multi-ship collaborative collision avoidance based on the algorithm of Conflict Search (CS) and Space-Time Hybrid A-star (STHA). First, a static CA path is searched for each ship by using the space-time Hybrid A-star algorithm, and the conflict risk area is determined according to the ship safety distance constraint and fuzzy Collision Risk Index (CRI). Secondly, the space-time conflict constraint is introduced into the multi-ship cooperative CA scheme, and the binary tree is used to search for an optimal navigation path with no conflict and low cost. In addition, the optimal path is smoothed by using cubic interpolation to make the path consistent with actual navigation practice and ship maneuvering characteristics. Finally, considering the constraints of the International Regulations for Preventing Collisions at Sea (COLREGs), the typical two-ship and multi-ship encounter scenarios are designed and simulated to verify the effectiveness of the proposed method. Furthermore, a comparative analysis of actual encounters and encounters based on CS-STHA is also carried out.

Machine learning algorithms are an emerging approach in judging the risk of collision among vessels and supporting reliable decision-making prior to any behaviors for collision avoidance. As the result, it can be a good method to reduce errors caused by navigators’ carelessness. This article aims to propose an enhanced machine learning method to estimate ship collision risk and to support more reliable decision-making for ship collision risk. In order to estimate the ship collision risk, the conventional support vector machine (SVM) was applied. Regardless of the advantage of the SVM to resolve the uncertainty problem by using the collected ships’ parameters, it has inherent weak points. In this study, the relevance vector machine (RVM), which can present reliable probabilistic results based on Bayesian theory, was applied to estimate the collision risk. The proposed method was compared with the results of applying the SVM. It showed that the estimation model using RVM is more accurate and efficient than the model using SVM. We expect to support the reasonable decision-making of the navigator through more accurate risk estimation, thus allowing early evasive actions.","https://www.proquest.com/docview/2532386987?accountid=44943&bdid=84593&_bd=j%2F5gzvfM3Sn3vuhkq5pH%2FFJcc9w%3D","https://doi.org/10.3390/jmse9050538"

These materials owe this popularity surge to the superior strength, weight, stiffness, and electrical insulation they exhibit over conventional substances, such as metals. The growing demand for such materials is accompanied by the inevitable need for fast, accurate, and affordable nondestructive testing techniques to reveal any possible defects within the coatings or any defects under coating. However, typical nondestructive testing (NDT) techniques such as ultrasonic testing (UT), infrared thermography (IRT), eddy current testing (ECT), and laser shearography (LS) have failed to provide successful results when inspecting composite coatings. Consequently, microwave NDT techniques have emerged to compensate for the shortcomings of traditional NDT approaches. Numerous microwave NDT methods have been reported for composite coatings inspection. Although existing microwave NDT methods have shown successful inspection of composite coatings, they often face several challenges, such as low spatial image quality and extensive data interpretation. Nevertheless, many of these limitations can be addressed by utilizing microwave NDT techniques with modern technologies such as soft computing. Artificially intelligent techniques have greatly enhanced the reliability and accuracy of microwave NDT techniques. This paper reviews various traditional NDT techniques and their limitations in inspecting composite coatings. In addition, the article includes a detailed review of several microwave NDT techniques and their benefits in evaluating composite coatings. The paper also highlights the advantages of using the recently reported microwave NDT approaches employing artificial intelligence approaches. This review demonstrates that microwave NDT techniques in conjunction with artificial intelligence approaches have excellent prospects for further enhancing composite coatings inspection and assessment efficiency. The review aimed to provide the reader with a comprehensive overview of most NDT techniques used for composite materials alongside their most salient features.","https://www.proquest.com/docview/2565041418?accountid=44943&bdid=84593&_bd=GT96qVYCNBsqOh%2FpjnOabftBa7g%3D","https://doi.org/10.3390/coatings11080913"

Traditionally, Automatic Identification System (AIS) is used to extract the ship speed information. However, transportation environment is gradually becoming complex, especially in the busy water, leading to the loss of some AIS data and resulting in a variety of maritime accidents. To make up for this deficiency, this paper proposes a vessel speed extraction framework, based on Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) airborne video. Firstly, YOLO v4 is employed to detect the ship targets in UAV image precisely. Secondly, a simple online and real time tracking method with a Deep association metric (Deep SORT) is applied to track ship targets with high quality. Finally, the ship motion pixel is computed based on the bounding box information of the ship trajectories, at the same time, the ship speed is estimated according to the mapping relationship between image space and the real space. Exhaustive experiments are conducted on the various scenarios. Results verify that the proposed framework has an excellent performance with average speed measurement accuracy is above 93% in complex waters.

Smart contracts (i.e., programs running on the blockchain) enabled organizations to envision and implement solutions to real‐world problems in less cost and time. Given the immutability of blockchain and the lack of best practices for properly designing and developing smart contracts, it is crucial to assure smart contract quality before deployment. With the help of an exploratory survey involving developers and researchers, this paper identifies the practices and tools used to develop, implement, and evaluate smart contracts. The survey received 55 valid responses. Such responses indicate that (i) inefficiencies may occur during the development cycle of a smart contract, especially regarding requirements specification, design, and testing phases, and (ii) the lack of a shared standard to evaluate the functional quality of implemented smart contracts. To start coping with these issues, the adoption of functional suitability assessment measures recommended by the ISO/IEC 25000 standard, widely used in software engineering, is proposed by adapting them to the context of smart contracts. Through some examples, the manuscript also illustrates how to measure the functional completeness and correctness of smart contracts. The proposed procedure to measure smart contract functional suitability brings advantages to both developers and users of decentralized finance or non‐fungible tokens platforms, data marketplaces, or shipping and real estate services, just to mention a few. In particular, it helps (i) better outline the responsibilities of smart contracts, (ii) uncover errors and deficiencies of smart contracts in the early stages, and (iii) ensure that the established requirements are met.","https://www.proquest.com/docview/3080004286?accountid=44943&bdid=84593&_bd=Ii8GNQMYCAGtID7%2FBRSU3wQynTg%3D","https://doi.org/10.1002/smr.2636"

Larger ships pose multiple challenges to ports and hinterland connections as well as to the beneficial cargo owners. To achieve maximum utilization of their larger vessels, carriers have entered cooperative global alliances on predetermined routes, resulting in new discharge patterns at U.S. ports. These multi-partner networks involve several competing firms which voluntarily and interactively engage in service delivery. Container carriage is increasingly competitive, and requires continuing cost reductions. There is increasing evidence, however, that cargo shippers are less satisfied with the service their supply chains are receiving. Standardizing process performance through supply chain integration and removing inefficiency will be needed to stabilize the international shipping market, but the question remains how ocean carriers will be able differentiate themselves and create improved supply chain performance. This paper suggests an answer through a simple standard performance measurement model.

Charlotte (North Carolina), ISSN 0749-0208.Rivers in the Republic of Korea are classified into two types: national and local rivers. While large-scale national rivers are systematically managed and maintained by local governments, there are still limitations in managing small-scale local rivers. Various problems occur in these sites, such as illegal cultivation and farming, installation of shipping container houses and temporary buildings, garbage disposal, and installation of canopies, among others. Subsequently, disputes arise from unauthorized vehicle entries to collect aggregates. It also leads to additional temporal and manpower losses from supervising the large river sites. Thus, the necessity of utilizing drones and artificial intelligence in managing river sites has become increasingly evident. This study was conducted to find an AI algorithm that use drone images to decipher discrete objects existing in the river site. To accomplish this, 9 objects (water, automobile, road, farmland, green house, temporary building, round bale silage, canopy, and garbage) in the river site were annotated and processed by algorithms such as YOLOv5, YOLOv7, DeepLabv3+, HRNet, and U-NET to determine the most optimal algorithm.

Secondly, the data information collected by the ship’s automatic identification system (AIS) is combined with density-based cluster analysis. The accident area and extent at different stages of the ship’s engine room equipment are classified. Finally, cluster analysis is used to evaluate the risk of equipment of the port ship engine room. The results show that there are 43000 ship operation information points in port a, the average operating speed of ships is 9 kilometers, and the fastest operation speed is 16.9 kilometers. In addition, many ship routes in port a need to take risk prevention measures to minimize the impact between ships and reduce the risk of oil leakage in the engine room. The proposed cabin model can easily and quickly analyze the orientation information of the ship and classify all the data into different types according to the surrounding information points. AIS can realize the information transfer between ships and between ship and shore. Information such as the position, speed, and direction of the ship needs to be accurately known to ensure safety at sea. These data need to relate to some terminals and networks to form a maritime monitoring network. The ship AIS based on cluster analysis can cluster the areas where the ship’s speed and direction change significantly in the port area, effectively preventing accidents.

However, the launch of the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) of the PR China in 2013 has given new impetus to Europe-Asia connectivity. Between 2014 and 2018 the number of block trains between China and Europe (including Russia) increased from 298 to 4,982 per year. Will this trend continue? Which bottlenecks and challenges appear? What are opportunities for respective countries, policy makers, shippers and logistics operators? The paper contributes to the scientific question of further and sustainable segmentation of intermodal transport markets in the context of global supply chains.Methods: Based on a literature review and interviews with logistics operators and shippers the authors analyze the present design and operational parameters of the intermodal land bridge traffic system, major challenges and bottlenecks and propose measure how to enable further growth and to improve the sustainability of this traffic.Results: Main issues of the further development of the New Silk Road Europe China are technological innovations, digitalization of supply chains, optimizing of intermodal transport and gateway concepts, corridor management and new trading patterns with e-commerce.Conclusions: Although this intermodal land bridge connection will likely continue to be a niche market, it offers considerable transit time and cost savings for specific types of freight where air freight is too expensive and maritime logistics is too slow. At higher freight costs compared with the sea freight and lower fares than air cargo this is especially interesting for high value cargo and the Northern provinces of China; also for opportunities in Central Asia, and the Caucasus. The new transport route promotes not only investments into production sites for export at locations in the Northern provinces but also opens new opportunities for European exports of industrial goods and FMCG for the growing middle class in China. The total logistics costs from the viewpoint of a shipper can be more competitive via land bridge than via sea.

Source apportionment of dissolved organic matter (DOM) was investigated in our work. Parallel factor analysis (PARAFAC) and the Spearman correlation analysis were used for source identification. After that, a newly hybrid model applying the fuzzy c-means and support vector regression (FCM-SVR) was employed for source apportionment compared to receptor models. The results demonstrated that the FCM-SVR model exhibited excellent generalization, and only required standardization and normalization as pre-processing steps for dataset. According to the results, microbial sources played a key role (28.1 %) in the formation potential of disinfection byproducts (DBPFPs). Additionally, shipping marine sources exhibited a substantial contribution (21.2 %) to DBPFPs. The prediction accuracy of DBPFPs was matched or exceeded receptor models, and the R² of DOC (0.884) was significantly high. Therefore, we recommend the FCM-SVR model combined with PARAFAC to trace the source of DBPFPs as its significant effectiveness in source identification, source apportionment, and prediction accuracy, possessing the potential for further applicability in tracking more organic compounds. The disinfection byproducts precursors in water sources, which were thought to be hazardous materials in this study, are proved to be chlorinated into carcinogenic disinfection byproducts (DBPs) during drinking water treatment, However, the source apportionment methods of DBPs are not well developed compared to other inorganic matter, e.g., heavy metals and ammonia nitrogen. We proposed a new FCM-SVR model to trace the source of DBPs, which required easier pre-treatment and resulted a better source apportionment and prediction accuracy. As a result, it could provide a different prospect and useful management advices to trace the source of DBPs.","https://www.proquest.com/docview/3040380581?accountid=44943&bdid=84593&_bd=C2Jllh9Oa%2BwQ1qAETLbcQROhpfY%3D","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2023.169671"

Various control strategies have been developed for the agent (i.e., robots or vehicles) to sense the environment, assess the situation, and select the optimal actions to avoid collision and accomplish its mission. In our research on autonomous ships, we take a machine learning approach to collision avoidance. The lack of available ship steering data of human ship masters has made it necessary to acquire collision avoidance knowledge through reinforcement learning (RL). Given that the learned neural network tends to be a black box, it is desirable that a method is available which can be used to design an agent's behavior so that the desired knowledge can be captured. Furthermore, RL with complex tasks can be either time consuming or unfeasible. A multi-stage learning method is needed in which agents can learn from simple tasks and then transfer their learned knowledge to closely related but more complex tasks. In this paper, we explore the ways of designing agent behaviors through tuning reward functions and devise a transfer RL method for multi-stage knowledge acquisition. The computer simulation-based agent training results have shown that it is important to understand the roles of each component in a reward function and the various design parameters in transfer RL. The settings of these parameters are all dependent on the complexity of the tasks and the similarities between them.","https://www.proquest.com/docview/2419593366?accountid=44943&bdid=84593&_bd=sTSn7HK4mkNxcl5UHbmliXLbEco%3D","https://doi.org/10.1017/S0890060420000141"

Our method involved interviewing technology designers (n = 9) and navigators aboard two partially automated ferries (n = 5), as well as collecting field observations aboard one of the ferries. The results indicated a discrepancy between how designers construed human-AI collaboration compared to navigators’ own accounts in the field. Navigators reflected upon their role as one of ‘backup,’ defined by ad-hoc control takeovers from the automation. Designers positioned navigators ‘in the loop’ of a larger control system but discounted the role of in-situ skills and heuristic decision making in all but the most controlled takeover actions. The discrepancy shed light on how integration of AI systems may be better aligned to human cooperation in navigation. This included designing AI systems that render computational activities more visible and that incorporate social cues that articulate human work in its natural setting.

A better understanding of their major causes, probability of occurrence, and consequences enables society to be better prepared to save human lives as well as to invest in adaptation options.  Natural hazards related to climate change are identified as one of the Grand Challenges in the Baltic Sea region. Here, we summarize existing knowledge about extreme events in the Baltic Sea region with a focus on the past 200 years as well as on future climate scenarios. The events considered here are the major hydro-meteorological events in the region and include wind storms, extreme waves, high and low sea levels, ice ridging, heavy precipitation, sea-effect snowfall, river floods, heat waves, ice seasons, and drought. We also address some ecological extremes and the implications of extreme events for society (phytoplankton blooms, forest fires, coastal flooding, offshore infrastructure, and shipping). Significant knowledge gaps are identified, including the response of large-scale atmospheric circulation to climate change and also concerning specific events, for example, the occurrence of marine heat waves and small-scale variability in precipitation. Suggestions for future research include the further development of high-resolution Earth system models and the potential use of methodologies for data analysis (statistical methods and machine learning). With respect to the expected impacts of climate change, changes are expected for sea level, extreme precipitation, heat waves and phytoplankton blooms (increase), and cold spells and severe ice winters (decrease).

When defining “autonomy,” the European Union (EU) regulations, among other jurisdictions, employ an all-or-nothing approach, according to which a drone is either able to operate fully autonomously or not at all. This dichotomous approach disregards the various levels of drone autonomy and fails to capture the complexity of civilian drone operation. Within the EU, this has regulatory implications, such as regulatory lag, hindrance in better safety regulation, and incoherence with the Union’s regulatory approach towards Artificial Intelligence (AI). This article argues that understanding autonomy as a spectrum, rather than in a dichotomous way, would be more coherent with the technical functioning of drone and would avoid potential regulatory problems caused by the current dichotomous approach. In delineating this spectral approach, this article (1) analyses manifestations of autonomy in drone operations, (2) delineates efforts in the technical literatures and drone standardization to conceptualize “autonomy”, and (3) explores definitional attempts for autonomy made in three other technologies: self-driving cars, autonomous weapon systems, and autonomous maritime ships.","https://www.proquest.com/docview/2963015482?accountid=44943&bdid=84593&_bd=1%2FXiRCQKu%2BSeYoXJbXw%2Fn%2Fxeygw%3D","https://doi.org/10.1007/s10846-024-02056-9"

Currently, a new ship is expected to use the ISO15016 method in estimating added resistance induced by external environmental factors in power prediction. However, since ISO15016 usually assumes static water conditions, it may result in low accuracy when it is applied to various operating conditions. Moreover, it is time consuming to apply the ISO15016 method because it is computationally expensive and requires many input data. To overcome this limitation, we propose a data-driven approach to predict the propulsion power of a vessel.

Knowledge of TOC masses and their contributing species is needed for improved modeling of cloud processing of organics and to understand how aerosols and gases impact and are impacted by clouds. This work relies on 159 samples collected with an axial cyclone cloud-water collector at altitudes of 0.2–6.8 km that had sufficient volume for both TOC and speciated organic composition analysis. Species included monocarboxylic acids (glycolate, acetate, formate, and pyruvate), dicarboxylic acids (glutarate, adipate, succinate, maleate, and oxalate), methanesulfonic acid (MSA), and dimethylamine (DMA). TOC values range between 0.018 and 13.66 ppm C with a mean of 0.902 ppm C. The highest TOC values are observed below 2 km with a general reduction aloft. An exception is samples impacted by biomass burning for which TOC remains enhanced at altitudes as high as 6.5 km (7.048 ppm C). Estimated total organic matter derived from TOC contributes a mean of 30.7 % to total measured mass (inorganics +organics). Speciated organics contribute (on a carbon mass basis) an average of 30.0 % to TOC in the study region and account for an average of 10.3 % to total measured mass.The order of the average contribution of species to TOC, in decreasing contribution of carbon mass, is as follows (±1 standard deviation): acetate (14.7 ±20.5 %), formate (5.4 ±9.3 %), oxalate (2.8 ±4.3 %), DMA (1.7 ±6.3 %), succinate (1.6 ±2.4 %), pyruvate (1.3 ±4.5 %), glycolate (1.3 ±3.7 %), adipate (1.0 ±3.6 %), MSA (0.1 ±0.1 %), glutarate (0.1 ±0.2 %), and maleate (<0.1 ±0.1 %). Approximately 70 % of TOC remains unaccounted for, highlighting the complex nature of organics in the study region; in samples collected in biomass burning plumes, up to 95.6 % of TOC mass is unaccounted for based on the species detected. Consistent with other regions, monocarboxylic acids dominate the speciated organic mass (∼75 %) and are about 4 times more abundant than dicarboxylic acids.Samples are categorized into four cases based on back-trajectory history, revealing source-independent similarity between the bulk contributions of monocarboxylic and dicarboxylic acids to TOC (16.03 %–23.66 % and 3.70 %–8.75 %, respectively). Furthermore, acetate, formate, succinate, glutarate, pyruvate, oxalate, and MSA are especially enhanced during biomass burning periods, which is attributed to peat emissions transported from Sumatra and Borneo. Lastly, dust (Ca2+) and sea salt (Na+/Cl-) tracers exhibit strong correlations with speciated organics, supporting how coarse aerosol surfaces interact with these water-soluble organics.","https://www.proquest.com/docview/2575224373?accountid=44943&bdid=84593&_bd=camejivJWPlp2PZ8DqmfH4NdjKM%3D","https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-21-14109-2021"

Recently, research is being conducted on the automatic prediction of the weight of Hanwoo only through images with the achievement of research using deep learning and image recognition. In this paper, we propose a method for the automatic weight prediction of Hanwoo using the Bayesian ridge algorithm on RGB-D images. The proposed system consists of three parts: segmentation, extraction of features, and estimation of the weight of Korean cattle from a given RGB-D image. The first step is to segment the Hanwoo area from a given RGB-D image using depth information and color information, respectively, and then combine them to perform optimal segmentation. Additionally, we correct the posture using ellipse fitting on segmented body image. The second step is to extract features for weight prediction from the segmented Hanwoo image. We extracted three features: size, shape, and gradients. The third step is to find the optimal machine learning model by comparing eight types of well-known machine learning models. In this step, we compared each model with the aim of finding an efficient model that is lightweight and can be used in an embedded system in the real field. To evaluate the performance of the proposed weight prediction system, we collected 353 RGB-D images from livestock farms in Wonju, Gangwon-do in Korea. In the experimental results, random forest showed the best performance, and the Bayesian ridge model is the second best in MSE or the coefficient of determination. However, we suggest that the Bayesian ridge model is the most optimal model in the aspect of time complexity and space complexity. Finally, it is expected that the proposed system will be casually used to determine the shipping time of Hanwoo in wild farms for a portable commercial device.","https://www.proquest.com/docview/2670135288?accountid=44943&bdid=84593&_bd=7lxNGrTxuEwpUSlygJ9qFkdaEoo%3D","https://doi.org/10.3390/electronics11101663"

The research results (e.g., a significant distance of the Baltic II from the nearest customary shipping route equal to 3 Nm, a small number of vessels in its area in 2017 amounting to only 930) obtained on the basis of the annual AIS data set allowed for an unambiguous and reliable assessment of the impact of OWFs on shipping, thus confirming the suitability of the methodology for MREI spatial planning.","https://www.proquest.com/docview/2584396518?accountid=44943&bdid=84593&_bd=PNQMWghLBJT7PKHWDCTMQlWN6YE%3D","https://doi.org/10.3390/en14206559"
"Study on Online Shopping Customer Experience and Buying Behaviour of Male Customers with respect to Apparels in Mumbai","","Barretto, Leanne; John, Jackson","Sansmaran Research Journal","Scholarly Journals","","","","2018-01-01","2018","1","13","1-13","22787801","","","ENG","The traditional forms of shopping have slowly yet steadily gravitated towards more modern approaches to shopping. Today digitization has taken over the shopping domain, thus giving rise to the era of ecommerce. Currently, only 14% of India's Internet user base are shopping online and this is estimated to increase to 50% by 2026. Even though men tend to predominantly shop online for an array of products, very few of them shop for clothes online compared to women. This study aimed to understand the online buying behaviour of men with respect to clothes and how important customer experience is for the online male customer. Gaining an understanding of the male shopping behaviour can be used to create an enriching and engaging customer experience thus also leading to loyalty towards the online retailer. Understanding the customers' needs helps retailers provide the best product and experience to the customer every time. The study used both primary and secondary sources of data. The primary study was conducted with 51 male online shoppers residing in Mumbai, wherein a questionnaire was used to gather relevant data. Data analysis was done by using 1 sample z test. The findings suggested that the reasons why men preferred shopping for clothes online were the discounts and the wide assortment that online retailers provided. Features such as variety of products/brands, easy search functions, free shipping, multiple payment options, accurate and clear size charts and easy return policies lead to an enjoyable customer experience. Male online shoppers valued the convenience provided by online retailers. The major fear associated with online buying of clothes was fitting issues and not being able to touch/feel the garment. Overall, the study indicated that male customers do give high importance to online customer experience.","https://www.proquest.com/docview/2090308032?accountid=44943&bdid=84593&_bd=tW52WvuZustZhNp%2F8aE2koOrJ94%3D",""

Here, we present evidence from an atmospheric general circulation model (AGCM) forced by the history of observed sea surface temperature (SST) that the Walker Circulation may have intensified rather than weakened. Observed Equatorial Indo-Pacific Sector SST since 1870 exhibited a zonally asymmetric evolution: While the eastern part of the Equatorial Pacific showed only a weak warming, or even cooling in one SST dataset, the western part and the Equatorial Indian Ocean exhibited a rather strong warming. This has resulted in an increase of the SST gradient between the Maritime Continent and the eastern part of the Equatorial Pacific, one driving force of the Walker Circulation. The ensemble experiments with the AGCM, with and without time-varying external forcing, suggest that the enhancement of the SST gradient drove an anomalous atmospheric circulation, with an enhancement of both Walker and Hadley Circulation. Anomalously strong precipitation is simulated over the Indian Ocean and anomalously weak precipitation over the western Pacific, with corresponding changes in the surface wind pattern. Some sensitivity to the forcing SST, however, is noticed. The analysis of twentieth century integrations with global climate models driven with observed radiative forcing obtained from the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP) database support the link between the SST gradient and Walker Circulation strength. Furthermore, control integrations with the CMIP models indicate the existence of strong internal variability on centennial timescales. The results suggest that a radiatively forced signal in the Walker Circulation during the twentieth century may have been too weak to be detectable.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]","https://www.proquest.com/docview/1013444228?accountid=44943&bdid=84593&_bd=T8zAB795NmDuj8h%2Bywr4FNzmHkE%3D","https://doi.org/10.1007/s00382-011-1047-8"

Driven by this, this study was dedicated to improving the accuracy of ship fuel oil consumption (FOC) prediction and laying the foundation for optimizing energy-efficient operations. Firstly, we combined voyage reports and meteorological data and constructed six datasets containing different features. These features comprise navigation-related features encompassing sailing speed, displacement and trim, as well as meteorological features encompassing wind, wave, sea current, sea water salinity and sea water temperature. Secondly, we conducted experiments with 14 popular ML models on the datasets and compared the prediction performance of different models by a new scoring system. Finally, we explored the advantages and disadvantages of each dataset based on the model performance scoring results and analyzed the effects of related meteorological factors on FOC during navigation. The key findings of the proposed work were that extra trees (ET), random forest (RF), XGBoost, and LightGBM had good fitting and generalization performance. Set5, the dataset containing the most complete meteorological data, achieved the best prediction results. In particular, it had an R2 (test) of 0.9317 on the ET model, which was 1.97% higher than the R2 (test) of the dataset using only voyage reports. The conclusions can assist shipping companies in constructing a ship FOC prediction framework and developing ship fuel-saving strategies.","https://www.proquest.com/docview/3093619450?accountid=44943&bdid=84593&_bd=x7cb5kpkjDb4k1lbZcW5Jm3IYLU%3D","https://doi.org/10.1177/14750902231210047"

By applying the concept of L-converted traffic, it was found that the current maritime traffic volume is 5 to 20 ships per hour in the sea area near Gun-san Port. High-density sections were identified through density analysis based on maritime traffic volume, which ranged from 5 to 10 km, and sections with an area of 10 km or more were also analyzed. Considering the general traffic flow and density, it is necessary to set a route width of 10 km or more in the target sea area, as well as to design a minimum fairway width that ensures safety for all types of ocean use. In this study, four traffic flows were analyzed through machine learning and a comprehensive environmental stress model was created for the traffic flows. The amount of safety change according to the increase in traffic volume was compared and reviewed for a fairway width of 1 km to 10 km, which can be generally formed according to the characteristics of the sea area. In the assessment, we found that when the fairway width was 1–4 km and the L-converted traffic volume was 15 or more, the ES ≥ 750 value exceeded 10% of the total, thus creating a burden on the ship operators. In particular, it was found that the ES ≥ 750 value was 20% at most when the L-converted traffic volume was 20 or more. In a comprehensive analysis, the ES > 750 was found to be less than 10% when the fairway width was 6 km or more in the sea area with one crossing passage at 5 to 20 ships per hour, which was the experimental condition of this study, and the ship operator’s burden was determined to be insignificant. Based on these results, when designing routes between offshore wind farms that will be established in the future, we expect that it will be possible to design the minimum fairway width to ensure safety according to the traffic volume.","https://www.proquest.com/docview/2636123420?accountid=44943&bdid=84593&_bd=rk0izgoZMUSn4YMWEZYSLDWvOtM%3D","https://doi.org/10.3390/app12031535"

In mass cytometry, the rare earth metals used as reporters on antibodies allow determination of marker expression in individual cells. Barcode-based bioassays for CyTOF are able to encode and decode for different experimental conditions or samples within the same experiment, facilitating progress in producing straightforward and consistent results. Herein, an integrated protocol for automated sample preparation for barcoding used in conjunction with mass cytometry for clinical bioanalysis samples is described; we offer results of our work with barcoding protocol optimization. In addition, we present some points to be considered in order to minimize the variability of quantitative mass cytometry measurements. For example, we discuss the importance of having multiple populations during titration of the antibodies and effect of storage and shipping of labelled samples on the stability of staining for purposes of CyTOF analysis. Data quality is not affected when labelled samples are stored either frozen or at 4 °C and used within 10 days; we observed that cell loss is greater if cells are washed with deionized water prior to shipment or are shipped in lower concentration. Once the labelled samples for CyTOF are suspended in deionized water, the analysis should be performed expeditiously, preferably within the first hour. Damage can be minimized if the cells are resuspended in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) rather than deionized water while waiting for data acquisition.","https://www.proquest.com/docview/1956076228?accountid=44943&bdid=84593&_bd=m7h5KQACbCycW2zE%2Fy6CmTKSSdI%3D","https://doi.org/10.1007/s00216-017-0182-4"

MOPA is a high-throughput make-to-order (MTO) manufacturing system designed to handle thousands of prescription orders every day. Prescription orders are highly customized, and most of them consist of multiple medications that need to be collated before packaging and shipping. The completion time difference between the first and the last medications within the same order is defined as the order collation delay. This research mainly investigates the effects of machine flexibility and the proportion of multi-medication orders on the total collation delays. To solve this NP-hard problem, a genetic algorithm with a min-max Pareto objective function is used. The GA performance is compared to two industry heuristics: the longest processing time (LPT) and the least total workload (LTW). Experimental results indicate that a fully dedicated machine environment has 80 % more total collation delays as compared to a fully flexible machine environment and 25 % more total collation delays as compared to a multi-purpose machine environment. Experimental results also indicate that the GA can achieve the optimal makespan in most cases, while minimizing the total collation delays by 96 % when compared to LPT and LTW.","https://www.proquest.com/docview/2262153178?accountid=44943&bdid=84593&_bd=GiBRSCKz25fd7psFdv8TixrwhiM%3D","https://doi.org/10.1007/s00170-016-9123-1"

Unexploded ordnance poses a huge threat to maritime users, which is why navies and non-governmental organisations (NGOs) around the world are using dedicated advanced technologies to counter this threat. The measures taken by navies include mine countermeasure units (MCMVs) and mine-hunting technology, which relies on the use of sonar imagery to detect and classify dangerous objects. The modern mine-hunting technique is generally divided into three stages: detection and classification, identification, and neutralisation/disposal. The detection and classification stage is usually carried out using sonar mounted on the hull of a ship or on an underwater vehicle. There is now a strong trend to intensify the use of more advanced technologies, such as synthetic aperture sonar (SAS) for high-resolution data collection. Once the sonar data has been collected, military personnel examine the images of the seabed to detect targets and classify them as mine-like objects (MILCO) or non mine-like objects (NON-MILCO). Computer-aided detection (CAD), computer-aided classification (CAC) and automatic target recognition (ATR) algorithms have been introduced to reduce the burden on the technical operator and reduce post-mission analysis time. This article describes a target classification solution using a DLNN-based approach that can significantly reduce the time required for post-mission data analysis during underwater reconnaissance operations.","https://www.proquest.com/docview/3015025703?accountid=44943&bdid=84593&_bd=Dlu%2Bvz07yPs767qLh3Pn1NZ5700%3D","https://doi.org/10.2478/pomr-2024-0008"

The purpose of this study is to explore and categorize academic publications concerned with Maritime 4.0 to identify its current research status, main subject categories, emerging trends, current gaps, and future research directions. To provide a comprehensive review of the publications, the study used bibliometric analysis to conduct citation analysis (publication distribution, productive journals, and cross-country collaborations), cooccurrence of the subject categories, cocitation analysis, and keyword frequency analysis. In doing so, the study utilized the Web of Science (WoS) dataset and software packages for data analysis. Finally, the study proposed a research framework composed of five themes to link current research topics with future research trends in Maritime 4.0. The five themes observed were “digitalization technology,” “methodology and techniques,” “management,” “safety and security,” and “environmental issues.” The results revealed that, although scholars and practitioners focused on Maritime 4.0, this area remained underdeveloped. Many scopes under the five themes were left unexplored, such as emerging paradigms of Internet of things (IoT) and blockchain under the theme of “digitalization,” hybrid models (e.g., game theory and genetic algorithms) under the theme of “methodology and techniques,” and social responsibility under the theme of “environmental issues.”","https://www.proquest.com/docview/2864955820?accountid=44943&bdid=84593&_bd=olgajEbBdyamctEHOfoC%2F7h3M50%3D","https://doi.org/10.1007/s13437-022-00298-8"

To speed up the detection process, the optimized histograms of oriented gradients (HOG) algorithm that can avoid the large number of double calculations of the original HOG and ignore insignificant features is used to describe the contour of the human body in real time. Based on the HOG features, using a training sample set consisting of scene images of a bulk port, a support vector machine (SVM) classifier combined with the AdaBoost classifier is trained to detect human. Finally, the results of the human detection experiments on Tianjin Port show that the accuracy of the proposed optimized algorithm has roughly the same accuracy as a traditional algorithm, while the proposed algorithm only takes 1/7 the amount of time. The accuracy and computing time of the proposed fast human-detection algorithm were verified to meet the security requirements of unmanned port areas.","https://www.proquest.com/docview/1628859948?accountid=44943&bdid=84593&_bd=RFBHS8C%2FiAQVKeQ%2BOanUxeJPI%2BQ%3D","https://doi.org/10.1155/2014/386764"

This paper also develops a framework for benchmarking freight rates based on the actual data.Design/methodology/approachThis paper proposes an additive dummy regression model to determine a statistical significance in shipping charges between different shippers. Unlike the traditional least square analysis, the proposed model is designed to avoid a biased assessment of the impact of an explanatory variable.FindingsThrough a series of empirical data analysis and hypothesis tests, the authors discovered that the fixed portion (minimum base charge) of shipping charges differed depending on the shipper’ individual contract, while the variable portion (fuel or accessorial charge) of shipping charges remained the same regardless of the shipper’s individual contract. As such, shippers who are unaware of flexible but unpredictable transportation pricing practices and unprepared for freight rate negotiation can suffer from higher shipping costs as compared to their peers. Thus, the authors conclude that the success of transportation outsourcing, carrier selection, and freight rate negotiation strategies tends to rest on the shipper’s ability to understand transportation cost structures and then determine the benchmark freight rate considered “fair” and “reasonable” for a given service.Originality/valueThis paper is one of the first to examine shipping cost differentials between different shippers and determine what causes such differentials. In doing so, this paper attempted to assess the potential impact of freight rate negotiation and carrier selection strategies on shippers’ transportation costs in current deregulatory environments where shippers were given a greater freedom to negotiate freight rates with carriers and an increased opportunity to save their transportation costs.","https://www.proquest.com/docview/1861768339?accountid=44943&bdid=84593&_bd=%2FkRuKJr5N4Gj89BBQtqsHOe%2Bxnw%3D","https://doi.org/10.1108/IJLM-01-2015-0030"

The authors have analyzed the ship domain as a criterion for the assessment of ship navigational safety in an encounter situation in the open sea. The research results are used to answer some of the questions.Part 2 includes definitions of the ship domain and ship fuzzy domain. Part 3, in turn, presents methods of their determination as well as relevant questions. The results of the authors' research, described in Part 4, make up a basis for the determination of the domain and ship fuzzy domain. These have been determined with the so-called dynamic domains as a point of departure. The criteria of ship domain and closest point of approach are compared and discussed. Encounters of various size ships are considered in Part 5. The research and its results are described. Both ship domains and ship fuzzy domains of encountering ships are analyzed. Then, conclusions have been formulated in relation to the effect of the sizes of encountering ships on the shapes and sizes of their domains. Final conclusions are given in Part 6.

For example, they share the temporal aspect, but different levels of urgency in the control work set different requirements on monitoring, decisions, and actions. However, few studies have been presented that model and compare the different domains in terms of temporal decision-making. The Joint Control Framework (JCF) is an approach to analyse and temporally model operators’ control processes from a cognitive systems engineering perspective. In this study, we have used JCF to map, and compare, cognitive joints, such as perceptions, decisions, and actions, in temporally challenging control situations in air traffic control, maritime vessel traffic service, and train traffic management. Data was collected collaboratively with traffic operators, focusing on (1) identifying challenging traffic situations and (2) jointly modelling the temporal decision-making patterns of these situations using simplified JCF. Post-analysis was done by breaking down the results into different processes and comparing domains to ascertain how operators maintain control. An intermediate level of activity—between general monitoring and work with specific vehicles—was identified: processes-in-focus. A shared problem arises in the shift between general monitoring and the processes-in-focus. All processes-in-focus comprise cognitive joint cycles of perceptions, decisions, and actions. However, depending on the framing of processes-in-focus, the patterns of joints, such as temporal extension and complexity, differ. In the remainder of the article, implications for the interaction design, in particular the potential for human–AI/automation teaming with higher levels of automation and cognitive autonomy, are discussed.","https://www.proquest.com/docview/3057565588?accountid=44943&bdid=84593&_bd=G2vhhKkv3xFX9YWobOPV%2FqppmNI%3D","https://doi.org/10.1007/s10111-024-00754-w"

However, the characteristics of China’s business-led and elite-oriented overseas development practices created policy gaps in high-risk countries. Based on interviews and fieldwork focused on Chinese State-Owned-Enterprises (SOEs) in Sri Lanka, this paper explores how globalization changed the nature of these SOEs: from policy executor to both policy maker and market actor in host countries and in China. However, these changes in nature and influence of key Chinese economic actors in host countries are actually not reflected by, and are in fact out of step with, the 1994 regulation that lays down the principle of non-interventionism in foreign assistance. Such a mismatch between expansionist business and restrained regulation leads to a new paradigm where businesses, especially SOEs, serve as a bridge between the host country and Beijing to identify areas where business interest and development needs intersect, thereby shaping development financing distribution in a way that facilitates SOEs’ ascension of the global value chain. However, the exclusion of the local private sector from expressing the most pressing needs makes the new paradigm insufficient to integrate the local supply chain. This, in turn, implies the new paradigm is less able to address debt sustainability problems, and geopolitical and ethnic tension in high-risk regions. In order to redress this imbalance, this paper proposes the inclusion of the private sector and civil society into China’s mainly business-led overseas development paradigm.","https://www.proquest.com/docview/3094747535?accountid=44943&bdid=84593&_bd=%2F6ux1r8udCZfwudPOdGFE1Idqko%3D","https://doi.org/10.5334/sta.fo"

Nevertheless, both processes do not commonly analyze the impact of security risks on safety. Several scholars are focused on integrating safety and security risk assessments, using different methodologies and tools in critical infrastructures (CIs). Bayesian networks (BN) and graph theory (GT) have received much attention from academia and industries to incorporate security and safety features for different CI applications. Hence, this study aims to conduct a systematic literature review (SLR) for co-engineering safety and security using BN or GT. In this SLR, the preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analyses recommendations (PRISMA) are followed. Initially, 2295 records (acquired between 2011 and 2020) were identified for screening purposes. Later on, 240 articles were processed to check eligibility criteria. Overall, this study includes 64 papers, after examining the pre-defined criteria and guidelines. Further, the included studies were compared, regarding the number of required nodes for system development, applied data sources, research outcomes, threat actors, performance verification mechanisms, implementation scenarios, applicability and functionality, application sectors, advantages, and disadvantages for combining safety, and security measures, based on GT and BN. The findings of this SLR suggest that BN and GT are used widely for risk and failure management in several domains. The highly focused sectors include studies of the maritime industry (14%), vehicle transportation (13%), railway (13%), nuclear (6%), chemical industry (6%), gas and pipelines (5%), smart grid (5%), network security (5%), air transportation (3%), public sector (3%), and cyber-physical systems (3%). It is also observed that 80% of the included studies use BN models to incorporate safety and security concerns, whereas 15% and 5% for GT approaches and joint GT and BN methodologies, respectively.

Added to this are the advances in the field of Computer Vision, especially in the use of models based on Artificial Intelligence, which allow the construction of robust and more precise detection systems. However, geographic scenarios, typical of a satellite image, limit the development of this type of system since they require the availability of a large number of images in different scenarios. In this paper, a new approach to Ship Detection is proposed using two new data sets labeled with horizontal bounding boxes (HBB). Likewise, a new labeling tool (DATATOOL) is presented that allows better organization and distribution of data. The new data sets, Peruvian Ship Dataset (PSDS) and Mini Ship Dataset (MSDS), have been generated from optical satellite images obtained from different sources. PSDS is created from 22 satellite images of PERUSAT-1 with 0.7m spatial resolution, giving a total of 1310 images.

Improvement of field performance through stock quality has been used for decades. Here, we use machine learning (ML) techniques to identify key stock traits involved in successful survival and to refine previous specifications that were developed under more conventional stock quality assessments carried out at the lifting–shipping phases in the nursery. Two differentiated stocklots in each species were used, both fitting in the regional quality standard. ML was used to infer a set of attributes for planted seedlings that were subsequently related to survival at the short-term (two years) and mid-term (ten years) in six different species planted in a harsh site with shallow soil that suffered the driest year on record during this study. Whilst stocklot quality, as measured in the lifting–shipping stage, had very poor importance to the survival response, individual plant traits presented a moderate to high diagnostic ability for seedling survival (area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve between 0.59 and 0.99). Early growth traits catch most of the importance in these models (≈40%), followed by individual morphology traits (≈28%) and site variation (≈2%), with overall means varying across species. Aleppo pine and Phoenician juniper stocklots presented survival rates of 66–78% after ten years, and these rates were below 27% for the remaining species that suffered during the historical drought. In Aleppo pine, the plant attributes related to early field performance (growth in the first growing season) were more important in the drought-mediated mid-term performance than stock quality at the nursery stage.

The integration of advanced machine learning technology for precise trajectory prediction is emerging as a new trend in sophisticated geospatial applications. However, the complexity of the marine environment and data quality issues pose significant challenges to accurate ship trajectory forecasting. This study introduces an innovative trajectory prediction method, combining data encoding representation, attribute correlation attention module, and long short-term memory network. Initially, we process AIS data using data encoding conversion technology to improve representation efficiency and reduce complexity. This encoding not only preserves key information from the original data but also provides a more efficient input format for deep learning models. Subsequently, we incorporate the attribute correlation attention module, utilizing a multi-head attention mechanism to capture complex relationships between dynamic ship attributes, such as speed and direction, thereby enhancing the model’s understanding of implicit time series patterns in the data. Finally, leveraging the long short-term memory network’s capability for processing time series data, our approach effectively predicts future ship trajectories. In our experiments, we trained and tested our model using a historical AIS dataset. The results demonstrate that our model surpasses other classic intelligent models and advanced models with attention mechanisms in terms of trajectory prediction accuracy and stability.","https://www.proquest.com/docview/3040421345?accountid=44943&bdid=84593&_bd=d2N4FayvssEu5N5ND7DPLthQF5Y%3D","https://doi.org/10.3390/ijgi13030085"

With the widespread of a very small business model and the Internet, online shopping has become part of people’s daily activity. People browse for desirable products at the comfort of their homes and ask the online vendor that a shipper can deliver the merchandise at their doorstep. Then, COD allows customers to pay in cash when the product is delivered to their desired location. Since customers receive goods before making a payment, COD is, therefore, considered as a payment system. However, the crucial issue that previous research has not yet addressed is that their models only support single delivering session at a time. More precisely, if the current buyer is not available to receive the goods, the shipper has to wastefully wait for the complete payment and he/she cannot start shipping another merchandise. The tracking system seems to poorly handle this issue.

The purpose of this paper is to examine the current ship registration situation and particularly the impact of the 2008 financial crisis on flagging behaviour in light of national characteristics. Design/methodology/approach - The paper provides an overview of ship registration over the past 14 years and picks up new trends in the changing global economy. Moreover, a panel data analysis is applied to examine flagging in/out on a state by state basis. Findings - The clear-cut distinction between national registration and open registration has been diminishing and a convergence has been observed between the two flag types. The sovereignty of states creates a set of regulatory niches. The panel data results show that the flagging behaviour varies from nation to nation. A shipowner's view on choice of flag might be affected by national characteristics, and different continents and ship types tend to exert different influences on flagging out. Practical implications - It is an oversimplification to assume the downfall of regulation and the rise of liberal deregulation, as different nations have different roles to play in this globalised maritime arena. At some point, an equilibrium may be established whereby the ratio of flagging out would reach a stable plateau within each nation. Originality/value - This paper identifies the new features of ship registration after the financial crisis. Whereas flagging behaviour has been examined before from many different perspectives, this study approaches the issue from a macroeconomic viewpoint and further elucidates the impact of national states on the globalised phenomenon of the shipping world.","https://www.proquest.com/docview/1373225399?accountid=44943&bdid=84593&_bd=DyQVkAF1O4AQR%2FtKVwMHWcmqxus%3D","https://doi.org/10.1108/IJLM-05-2013-0056"

Utilizing triboelectric nanogenerators (TENGs) to harvest ocean wave energy and power sensors is proven to be an effective scheme. However, in random ocean waves, the irregular electrical energy output by general TENGs restricts the applications. At present, achieving regularized water wave energy harvesting relies on rather complex mechanical structure designs, which is not conducive to industrialization. In this work, we proposed a novel mechanical controlled TENG (MC-TENG) with a simple controlled switch to realize the regularization function. The structural parameters of the MC-TENG are optimized, and the optimal output voltage, output current, and transferred charge respectively reach 1684.2 V, 85.4 µA, and 389.9 nC, generating a peak power density of 38.46 W·m−3·Hz−1. Under real water wave environment, the output of the MC-TENG is regularized and keeps stable regardless of any wave conditions. Moreover, the potential applications of the MC-TENG are demonstrated in powering environmental temperature, humidity, and wind speed sensors. This work renders a simple approach to achieve effective regularized ocean wave energy harvesting, promoting the TENG industrialization toward practical application of maritime IoTs.","https://www.proquest.com/docview/3087027333?accountid=44943&bdid=84593&_bd=s0ydzjvy8rFXO0%2FgKfq5%2F8AGGdE%3D","https://doi.org/10.1007/s12274-024-6679-1"

A large potential to reduce GHG emissions is offered by alternative fuels. In this perspective a Well-to-Wake (WtW) approach is due for a comprehensive analysis. The paper is focused on the evaluation of WtW CO2 equivalent emission factors for LNG, methanol, and ammonia. The extensive bibliographic research on this topic outlines the large differences occurring when considering grey or green fuel production pathways.

Combined with Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs), artificial intelligence, and computer vision, SAR operations can be revolutionized through enabling rescuers to expand ground coverage with improved detection accuracy whilst reducing costs and personal injury risks. However, detecting small objects is one of the significant challenges associated with using computer vision on UAVs. Several approaches have been proposed for improving small object detection, including data augmentation techniques like replication and variation of image sizes, but their suitability for SAR application characteristics remains questionable. To address these issues, this paper evaluates four float detection algorithms against the baseline and augmented datasets to improve float detection for maritime SAR. Results demonstrated that YOLOv8 and YOLOv5 outperformed the others in which F1 scores ranged from 82.9 to 95.3%, with an enhancement range of 0.1–29.2%.

Therefore, in addition to determining particle counts, it is crucial to accurately characterize particles in drug product to understand the stress condition of exposure and to implement appropriate mitigation actions for a specific formulation. In this study, we developed a new method for intelligent characterization of protein particles using micro-Raman spectroscopy on a digital microfluidic chip (DMF). Several microliters of protein particle solutions induced by stress degradation were loaded onto a DMF chip to generate multiple droplets for Raman spectroscopy testing. By training multiple machine learning classification models on the obtained Raman spectra of protein particles, eight types of protein particles were successfully characterized and predicted with high classification accuracy (93%–100%). The advantages of the novel particle characterization method proposed in this study include a closed system to prevent particle contamination, one-stop testing of morphological and chemical structure information, low sample volume consumption, reusable particle droplets, and simplified data analysis with high classification accuracy.

Through the logistics base of Singaporean-Chongqing cooperation in multimodal transport, Chongqing can play an important role as a channel operation center and an important logistics hub. Some international shipping resources will be extended to Chongqing, letting the whole western region share the agricultural by-products brought by Southeast Asian countries. Multimodal transport is a common mode of transport in international trade; it combines various modes of transport organically, brings into play the advantages of various modes of transport, and can reduce costs to a large extent. At present, multimodal transport is mostly used for importing and exporting goods; multimodal transport is not widely used in agricultural by-product logistics transportation. Multimodal combination will be used in the transportation of agricultural by-product logistics; it can avoid the shortcomings of simply using road transportation and make the logistics transportation cost of agricultural by-products lower and management more convenient.

Varying wave height is one of the most prominent causes that lead to this inefficiency in the ship’s autopilot system. Current state-of-the-art methods in the domain include building machine and deep learning-based models to estimate wave height. However, the existing systems have several limitations, such as difficulty in handling abrupt non-linear and chaotic variations present in the data, low generalizability, noise sensitivity, and many more.

What are the future extreme risks in the ocean and fisheries sector? In: Lee, J.L.; Lee, H.; Min, B.I.; Chang, J.-I.; Cho, G.T.; Yoon, J.-S., and Lee, J. (eds.), Multidisciplinary Approaches to Coastal and Marine Management. Journal of Coastal Research, Special Issue No. 116, pp. 388-392. Charlotte (North Carolina), ISSN 0749-0208.As modern society becomes increasingly complex, extreme risks—or so-called X-events—are occurring more and more frequently, with increased ripple effects. A great variety of risks, such as the 9/11 terrorist attacks, the global financial crisis, the Fukushima nuclear disaster, and the COVID-19 pandemic, can occur anytime and anywhere. As such, international organizations and governments strive to preemptively discover risks, measure their impact, and strengthen resilience. However, research on risks confronting the ocean and fisheries sector has been insufficient. Research that relies solely on the patterns of past risks inevitably misses the possibility of discovering new future risks and comprehending their ripple effects alongside co-occurrent multiple risks. This study proposes a framework for discovering possible future risks in the ocean and fisheries based on their possibility of occurrence, ripple effect, and resilience. For this purpose, a vast amount of data is collected from academic journals and online social media and analyzed using topic modeling, followed by expert interviews and a survey of the public. Four main sub-sectors of the ocean and fisheries sector are analyzed: marine, fisheries, shipping logistics, and ports. Risks related to the marine environment and marine-caused natural disasters are rated highly in the marine sector. In fisheries, the radioactive contamination of aquatic products ranks first. In shipping and logistics, issues like global competition over the logistics supply chain and logistics paralysis due to natural disasters are of primary concern. In the port sub-sector, issues like the competition between ports and the negative effects of digitalization on job loss and cyber security top the list. The most significant risk in the ocean and fisheries sector as a whole is the “acceleration of global warming,” followed by the “occurrence of super typhoons” and “increase in marine plastic waste.”","https://www.proquest.com/docview/2914747063?accountid=44943&bdid=84593&_bd=na%2BNC0Gfc8uPo3dPD1x4qBe32MQ%3D","https://doi.org/10.2112/JCR-SI116-079.1"

Shipping, processing, and refurbishing are so costly that a retailer's profit is extremely sensitive to return rates. Using a large data set from a European apparel retailer, we observe that return rates for fashion items bought online range from 13% to 96%, with an average of 53%; many items are not profitable. Because fashion seasons are over before sufficient data on return rates are observed, retailers need to anticipate each item's return rate prior to launch. We use product images and traditional measures available prelaunch to predict individual item return rates and decide whether to include the item in the retailer's assortment. We complement machine-based prediction with automatically extracted image-based interpretable features. Insights suggest how to select and design fashion items that are less likely to be returned. Our illustrative machine-learning models predict well and provide face-valid interpretations; the focal retailer can improve profit by 8.3% and identify items with features less likely to be returned. We demonstrate that other machine-learning models do almost as well, reinforcing the value of using prelaunch images to manage returns.","https://www.proquest.com/docview/2894462027?accountid=44943&bdid=84593&_bd=NakJGD8EIbz%2Bb%2FPzsnQOTVWDUY0%3D","https://doi.org/10.1287/mksc.2023.1451"

In recent years, the remote sensing community has proposed several solutions to the problem of ship object classification in SAR images. However, it is difficult to obtain an adequate amount of labeled SAR samples for training classifiers, which limits the application of machine learning, particularly deep learning methods, in SAR image ship object classification. In contrast, as a real-time automatic tracking system for monitoring ships at sea, a ship automatic identification system (AIS) can provide a large amount of relatively easy-to-obtain labeled ship samples. Therefore, to solve the problem of SAR image ship classification and improve the classification performance of learning models with limited samples, we proposed a SAR image ship classification method based on multiple classifiers ensemble learning (MCEL) and AIS data transfer learning. The core idea of our method is to transfer the MCEL model trained on AIS data to SAR image ship classification, which mainly includes three steps: first, we use the acquired global space-based AIS data to build a dataset for ship object classification models training; then, the ensemble learning model is constructed by combining multiple base classifiers; and finally, the trained classification model is transferred to SAR images for ship type prediction. Experiments show that the proposed method achieves a classification accuracy of 85.00% for the SAR ship classification, which is better than the performance of each base classifier. This proves that AIS data transfer learning can effectively solve the problem of SAR ship classification with limited samples, and has important application value in maritime surveillance.","https://www.proquest.com/docview/2771659927?accountid=44943&bdid=84593&_bd=9d2TUFmB9tZ%2Fn3thN2%2FmaZgXMXk%3D","https://doi.org/10.3390/rs14215288"

Second, the paper examines the potential of machine learning algorithms to represent worker abuse at sea, arguing that more extensive ground-truthing research with workers could help address variations in the data and limited data sets. Third, I use remote sensing data to identify and unpack Taiwanese fishing across the three EEZs with the most concentrated Taiwanese fishing activity: starting with Taiwan, followed by the Falkland Islands, and Seychelles. I argue that fishing activity and the digital representation of vessel movements are governed by terrestrial geopolitics and subject to manipulation by ship captains.

Different value of travel time and cost scenarios are explored, to provide a sense of variation in the uncertain future of ground-based trade flows. Using the current U.S. Freight Analysis Framework (FAF4) data for travel times and costs—and assuming that Atrucks lower trucking costs by 25% (per ton-mile delivered), truck flow values in ton-miles are predicted to rise 11%, due to automation’s lowering of trucking costs, while rail flow values fall 4.8%. Rail flows are predicted to rise 6.6% for trip distances between 1000 and 1500 miles, with truck volumes rising for all other distance bands.

The proposed architecture uses a series of CMSAE networks to process in parallel each of the objectives defined as different classes. The output of these networks are given to a machine learning classifier to perform the final detection. Results show that the proposed approach can reliably detect oil spills and other maritime objects in SLAR sequences, outperforming the accuracy of previous state-of-the-art methods and with a response time of only 0.76 s.","https://www.proquest.com/docview/2307434405?accountid=44943&bdid=84593&_bd=OzUji4DemSV3pitlde5MZk3743U%3D","https://doi.org/10.3390/rs11121402"

The authors further analyze international trade realities and maritime companies’ requirements and identified inefficiencies. A comprehensive review of the relevant container regulations and identification standards is performed. Based on their findings, a paradigm change is proposed in the form of a modular container solution that uses disruptive digital technologies to ensure dynamic container identification (numbering) that can be exploited to overcome such inefficiencies. The technical requirements for coupling and decoupling operations are identified, along with detailed analysis of the requirements for embedded electronic components. Considering the strict container data exchange rules, the required changes in global container tracking systems are identified and explained. Coupling, decoupling, and serial number assignment procedures are proposed along with analysis of the measured lead times. Modularization and dynamic smart numbering are identified as viable disruptive technologies to address the global container imbalance. The authors contribute to the existing research on maritime transport sustainability by proposing a modular container solution, exploiting disruptive digital technologies, and clearly defining the prerequisites for the global introduction of the solution as a part of the digital transformation portfolio of involved stakeholders managing global container movements.","https://www.proquest.com/docview/2694069338?accountid=44943&bdid=84593&_bd=k2H4fFFwMGH2zOOHDu6IbNOF8CY%3D","https://doi.org/10.3390/su14148548"

Steers (n = 40; 20 steers per treatment; BW = 659 ± 72.9 kg) were weighed 40 h before harvest, blocked by BW (n = 4 BW blocks), and assigned to one of two treatments: no HydraFit (Con) or HydraFit (HF) added to the water at 4% vol/vol (4 pens/treatment, 8 pens total). Feed and water access was not restricted nor was a shrink percentage applied to any BW measures. Thirty-six hours before harvest a 378 L water tank was filled with water from the same source the steers had been consuming since arrival. Water and feed were introduced at 36 h before harvest. Final BW was captured immediately before shipping (12 h prior to harvest). Cattle were transported 98 km to a commercial abattoir. Cattle were held in lairage with ad libitum access to water before harvest the following morning. Water intake pre-shipment was determined after the cattle were removed from the pens and transported to slaughter. Water volume was estimated by measuring water depth remaining in the tank. Depth measurements were calibrated to water volume by metering (DM-P; Assured Automation, Roselle, NJ; ± 1.0%) 0.64 cm of water into each tank and recording the liters of water metered. Hot carcass weight was determined at the time of slaughter and cold carcass data was determined after a 48-hour chill. One steer from Con was condemned at the abattoir for reasons unrelated to treatment, consequently, the contribution of this steer to the pen mean was deleted. Providing HF in the drinking water for approximately 22 hours before shipping for harvest tended to increase final body weight (P = 0.08) by 1% but had no effect (P ≥ 0.88) on hot or cold carcass weight.

Therefore, this paper proposes a ship classification and anomaly detection method based on machine learning that considers ship behavior characteristics for spaceborne AIS data. In view of the characteristics of different types of ships, this paper introduces the extraction and analysis of ship behavior characteristics in addition to traditional geometric features and discusses the ability of the proposed method for ship classification and anomaly detection. The experimental results show that the classification accuracy of the five types of ships can reach 92.70%, and the system can achieve better results in the other classification evaluation metrics by considering the ship behavior characteristics.

Therefore, we propose developing a spatiotemporal approach that can describe and predict traffic flows within a region. We designed the model based on a multiple hexagon-based convolutional neural network (mh-CNN) model that takes both the flow dynamics and environmental conditions into account. This model is highly flexible in that it predicts zonal traffic flow within variable time windows. We applied the method to measure and predict the daily and hourly traffic flows in the South Atlantic States region by taking the impacts of extreme weather events into consideration.

However, USVs struggle to accomplish emerging computation-intensive tasks (e.g., sensor, telemetry, etc) timely due to the limited on-board resources. This article proposes a novel reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS)-assisted unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) multiaccess edge computing (MEC) network architecture to support low-latency USVs data computation with time window. Aiming to enhance USVs task processing efficiency, the minimization of USVs task processing time is formulated by jointly considering UAVs flight route selection, USVs execution mode selection, UAVs hovering coordinates, and RIS phase shift vector. A heuristic solution is proposed to tackle the formulated challenging problem iteratively. The original problem is decoupled into three subproblems: 1) an enhanced deferred acceptance algorithm is proposed to solve UAVs flight route selection subproblem; 2) an enhanced Lagrangian relaxation method is proposed to solve USVs execution mode selection subproblem; and 3) a joint alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMMs)-successive convex approximation (SCA)-based algorithm is proposed to solve UAVs hovering coordinates subproblem. Experiment results demonstrate that the proposed solution can decrease task processing time by approximately 54% compared with numerous selected advanced algorithms. Moreover, the performance of the proposed solution under typical UAVs caching capability and the number of UAVs has been investigated.","https://www.proquest.com/docview/3089923565?accountid=44943&bdid=84593&_bd=XTcbVcAzUIkz4r2tf3KnH%2BL931A%3D","https://doi.org/10.1109/JIOT.2024.3387017"

Determination of factors affecting the value of XTL safety parameter, with special consideration to chart data reliability, is elaborated in this paper. Chart data reliability depends on the quality of chart survey data, which in many cases are outdated and unreliable. Analysis of past research on this subject is used to define the factors affecting XTL. Practices of different shipping companies with regards to XTL are analyzed and compared in order to confirm if there is a uniform practice between them. Nevertheless, shipping companies have a different or no practice of obtaining XTL, which allows the navigator to define safety parameters by a subjective opinion. In this paper, method of XTL determination for a specific vessel is suggested, considering previously defined factors.

In the case of a maritime disaster, they can be used for personnel search and rescue, real-time monitoring, and disaster assessment. However, the power, computing power, and other resources of UAVs are often limited. Therefore, this paper combines a UAV and mobile edge computing (MEC), and designs a deep reinforcement learning-based online task offloading (DOTO) algorithm. The algorithm can obtain an online offloading strategy that maximizes the residual energy of the UAV by jointly optimizing the UAV’s time and communication resources. The DOTO algorithm adopts time division multiple access (TDMA) to offload and schedule the UAV computing task, integrates wireless power transfer (WPT) to supply power to the UAV, calculates the residual energy corresponding to the offloading action through the convex optimization method, and uses an adaptive K method to reduce the computational complexity of the algorithm. The simulation results show that the DOTO algorithm proposed in this paper for the energy-saving goal of maximizing the residual energy of UAVs in MEC can provide the UAV with an online task offloading strategy that is superior to other traditional benchmark schemes. In particular, when an individual UAV exits the system due to insufficient power or failure, or a new UAV is connected to the system, it can perform timely and automatic adjustment without manual participation, and has good stability and adaptability.","https://www.proquest.com/docview/2706189712?accountid=44943&bdid=84593&_bd=06xqHFb%2BFItHY%2BklQZbQrLdWaQA%3D","https://doi.org/10.3390/fi14080226"

It is also extremely important to control the ferry’s fuel consumption, being one of the most important cost components. The aim of the article is to draw the attention of shipping company managers to the great potential that lies in the use of routine operational data, collected exclusively on board the ferries. It is worth noting that the research in this paper is based on standard office software packages rather than advanced statistical methods of data analysis, which are usually not accessible for shipping managers. Contrary to typical ocean-going vessels, there are a number of factors that need to be taken into consideration when analyzing ro-pax ferry fuel consumption. Moreover, these factors occur, in many cases, accidentally and, thus, they are difficult to observe on board the ferry without utilizing expensive and time-consuming methods. The possibility of fuel control is important not only for economic reasons but also due to air pollution caused by engine exhausts. The article presents an estimation of increased fuel consumption caused by the degradation of the hull silicone anti-fouling coating. The presented estimations of fuel consumption may be treated as the base for calculations of the economic effectiveness of ferries.

It relied on a special telephone service and outreach consultations located in the town halls of the five most affected cities. The objective of this outreach service was to provide initial psychological counseling free of charge and without appointment. Another objective was to refer persons for appropriate treatment and follow-up by routine health care services. A surveillance program was developed to monitor the use of mental health services by first-time users, describe outreach service users with psychological manifestations, and provide timely information to decision makers.MethodsHealth providers working in affected towns were asked to complete an individual record sheet for each person who displayed psychological manifestations directly or indirectly linked with the storm on their first visit, and to send it to the regional health office. Participation was voluntary. Data analysis was performed monthly during the six-month surveillance period.ResultsOnly mental health providers participated in the surveillance. A total of 227 individual files were sent from April 7 through September 19, 2010. New cases were mainly female adults, and one fifth had a past history of psychiatric illness. Depressive signs and anxiety were the most commonly reported symptoms, followed by signs of post-traumatic stress disorder.

A visual interpretation of SAR data with the inclusion of optical high-resolution data are used to generate a validation dataset. Results show it is possible to semi-automatically detect riverine dredge using SAR and that a local detection method provides the best balance between sensitivity and precision and has the lowest risk of error.

Despite this, BSR ports are of a colossal importance for the regional economic development serving as gateways for the individual regions and drivers of socio-economic and environmental transition. In addition, ports are essential in pursuing new innovation avenues.

"Prediction of sea ice edge in the Antarctic using GVF Snake model","","Rana, Pravin K; Dash, Mihir K; Routray, A; Pandey, P C","Journal of the Geological Society of India","Scholarly Journals","","78","2","2011-08-01","Aug 2011","99","","99-108","00167622","","","ENG","Antarctic sea ice cover plays an important role in shaping the earth's climate, primarily by insulating the ocean from the atmosphere and increasing the surface albedo. The convective processes accompanied with the sea ice formation result bottom water formation. The cold and dense bottom water moves towards the equator along the ocean basins and takes part in the global thermohaline circulation. Sea ice edge is a potential indicator of climate change. Additionally, fishing and commercial shipping activities as well as military submarine operations in the polar seas need reliable ice edge information. However, as the sea ice edge is unstable in time, the temporal validity of the estimated ice edge is often shorter than the time required to transfer the information to the operational user. Hence, an accurate sea ice edge prediction as well as determination is crucial for fine-scale geophysical modeling and for near-real-time operations. In this study, active contour modelling (known as Snake model) and non-rigid motion estimation techniques have been used for predicting the sea ice edge (SIE) in the Antarctic. For this purpose the SIE has been detected from sea ice concentration derived using special sensor microwave imager (SSM/I) observations. The 15% sea ice concentration pixels are being taken as the edge pixel between ice and water. The external force, gradient vector flow (GVF), of SIE for total the Antarctic region is parameterised for daily as well as weekly data set. The SIE is predicted at certain points using a statistical technique. These predicted points have been used to constitute a SIE using artificial intelligence technique, the gradient vector flow (GVF). The predicted edge has been validated with that of SSM/I. It is found that all the major curvatures have been captured by the predicated edge and it is in good agreement with that of the SSM/I observation.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]","https://www.proquest.com/docview/888124737?accountid=44943&bdid=84593&_bd=gMA5Yn77cjve9270Is4ilnZZPlk%3D","https://doi.org/10.1007/s12594-011-0076-6"

The dataset is divided in two main classes (""Vessels"" and ""Other objects"") and each class is divided into four sub-classes (""Vessels"" sub-classes are ""Cargo ships"", ""Cruise ships'"" ""War ships"" and ""Boats"", while ""Other objects"" sub-classes are ""Waves'"" ""Marine animals'"" ""Garbage patches"" and ""Oil spills""). For recognition of marine objects, an algorithm constructed with three CNNs is proposed. The first CNN for classification on the main classes achieves accuracy of 92.37 %. The CNN used for vessels recognition achieves accuracies of 94.12 % for cargo ships recognition, 98.82 % for cruise ships recognition, 97.64 % for war ships recognition and 95.29 % for boats recognition.

Different whole blood RNA collection and processing methods are highly variable and might confound comparisons of results across studies. The main aim of the current study is to compare how blood storage, extraction methodologies, and the blood components themselves may influence gene expression profiling. Whole blood and peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) samples were collected in triplicate from five healthy donors. Whole blood was collected in RNAgard® and PAXgene® Blood RNA Tubes, as well as in collection tubes with anticoagulants such as dipotassium ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (K2EDTA) and Acid Citrate Dextrose Solution A (ACD-A). PBMCs were separated using sodium citrate Cell Preparation Tubes (CPT™), FICOLL™, magnetic separation, and the LeukoLOCK™ methods. After blood collection, the LeukoLOCK™, K2EDTA and ACD-A blood tubes were shipped overnight using cold conditions and samples from the rest of the collection were immediately frozen with or without pre-processing. The RNA was isolated from whole blood and PBMCs using a total of 10 different experimental conditions employing several widely utilized RNA isolation methods. The RNA quality was assessed by RNA Integrity Number (RIN), which showed that all PBMC procedures had the highest RIN values when blood was stabilized in TRIzol® Reagent before RNA extraction. Initial data analysis showed that human blood stored and shipped at 4°C overnight performed equally well when checked for quality using RNA integrity number when compared to frozen stabilized blood. Comparisons within and across donor/method replicates showed signal-to-noise patterns which were not captured by RIN value alone. Pathway analysis using the top 1000 false discovery rate (FDR) corrected differentially expressed genes (DEGs) showed frozen vs. cold shipping conditions greatly impacted gene expression patterns in whole blood. However, the top 1000 FDR corrected DEGs from PBMCs preserved after frozen vs. cold shipping conditions (LeukoLOCK™ preserved in RNAlater®) revealed no significantly affected pathways. Our results provide novel insight into how RNA isolation, various storage, handling, and processing methodologies can influence RNA quality and apparent gene expression using blood samples. Careful consideration is necessary to avoid bias resulting from downstream processing. Better characterization of the effects of collection method idiosyncrasies will facilitate further research in understanding the effect of gene expression variability in human sample types.","https://www.proquest.com/docview/2322376906?accountid=44943&bdid=84593&_bd=ydLsHb%2FxafCe7kxsXTqKMZhRW7c%3D","https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0225137"

Long-term SWL forecasts, which are conventionally obtained via harmonic analysis, become ineffective when nonperiodic meteorological events predominate. Artificial intelligence combined with other data-processing methods can effectively forecast highly nonlinear and nonstationary inflow patterns by recognizing historical relationships between input and output. These techniques are considerably useful in time-series data predictions. This paper reports the development of a hybrid model to realize accurate multihour SWL forecasting by combining an adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) with wavelet decomposition while using sea-level anomaly (SLA) and wind-shear-velocity components as inputs. Numerous wavelet-ANFIS (WANFIS) models have been tested using different inputs to assess their applicability as alternatives to the artificial neural network (ANN), wavelet ANN (WANN), and ANFIS models. Different error definitions have been used to evaluate results, which indicate that integrated wavelet-decomposition and ANFIS models improve the accuracy of SWL prediction and that the inputs of SLA and wind-shear velocity exhibit superior prediction capability compared to conventional SWL-only models.","https://www.proquest.com/docview/2919736527?accountid=44943&bdid=84593&_bd=53vMB65ntDGr%2FGDL0M%2BhuVoKFck%3D","https://doi.org/10.1007/s13131-020-1569-1"

Replicas of individual barnacles and barnacle colonies, and living colonies were studied in a 5 m seawater flume using tracer dyes, macro video-photography and image digitization and in a small flume fitted with differential pressure sensors. Using replicas, colonization densities were manipulated to determine the dynamics of complex barnacle populations. These techniques enabled the quantification of drag, boundary layers and their interrelationships with mean flow velocity and population density. These data show that mean stream velocity affected the size and magnitude of the boundary layer and that at higher velocities the flow over the height at which the cirri were operating was decreased proportionally greater than at low mean stream velocities. The effect on flow velocity over the cirri with increased boundary layer at higher mean stream velocities was assessed and an optimum mean stream velocity for flow over cirri identified. Density of barnacles was shown to have an effect on the flow characteristics over the population, with flow changing from independent flow at low densities, through interactive flow to skimming flow at higher densities. Drag was also shown to be affected by barnacle density.

Forty healthy male study participants were enrolled in Pittsburgh and Los Angeles. MMC were isolated from rectal biopsies using the same biopsy acquisition and enzymatic digestion protocols. As an additional comparator, peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) were collected from the study participants. For quality control, cryopreserved PBMC from a single donor were supplied to both sites from a central repository (qPBMC). Using a jointly optimized standard operating procedure, cells were isolated from tissue and blood and stained with monoclonal antibodies targeted to T cell phenotypic markers. Site-specific flow data were analyzed by an independent center which analyzed all data from both sites. Ranges for frequencies for overall CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, derived from the qPBMC samples, were equivalent at both UCLA and MWRI. However, there were significant differences across sites for the majority of T cell activation and memory subsets in qPBMC as well as PBMC and MMC. Standardized protocols to collect, stain, and analyze MMC and PBMC, including centralized analysis, can reduce but not exclude variability in reporting flow data within multi-site studies. Based on these data, centralized processing, flow cytometry, and analysis of samples may provide more robust data across multi-site studies. Centralized processing requires either shipping of fresh samples or cryopreservation and the decision to perform centralized versus site processing needs to take into account the drawbacks and restrictions associated with each method.","https://www.proquest.com/docview/1683369314?accountid=44943&bdid=84593&_bd=%2BD5upfzOlR1i6sx0yR5qw1EKnhI%3D","https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0126454"

The rapid growth of the industry causes societal pressure on controlling the emission levels produced by ships. All the methods currently used for ship emission monitoring are costly and require proximity to a ship, which makes global and continuous emission monitoring impossible. A promising approach is the application of remote sensing. Studies showed that some of the NO2plumes from individual ships can visually be distinguished using the TROPOspheric Monitoring Instrument on board the Copernicus Sentinel 5 Precursor (TROPOMI/S5P). To deploy a remote-sensing-based global emission monitoring system, an automated procedure for the estimation of NO2emissions from individual ships is needed. The extremely low signal-to-noise ratio of the available data, as well as the absence of the ground truth makes the task very challenging. Here, we present a methodology for the automated segmentation of NO2plumes produced by seagoing ships using supervised machine learning on TROPOMI/S5P data. We show that the proposed approach leads to more than a 20% increase in the average precision score in comparison to the methods used in previous studies and results in a high correlation of 0.834 with the theoretically derived ship emission proxy.

The lidar observations were performed at Barbados during the Saharan Aerosol Long-Range Transport and Aerosol-Cloud-Interaction Experiment (SALTRACE) in the summer of 2014. The POLIPHON method comprises the traditional lidar technique to separate mineral dust and non-dust backscatter contributions and the new, extended approach to separate even the fine and coarse dust backscatter fractions. We show that the traditional and the advanced method are compatible and lead to a consistent set of dust and non-dust profiles at simplified, less complex aerosol layering and mixing conditions as is the case over the remote tropical Atlantic. To derive dust mass concentration profiles from the lidar observations, trustworthy extinction-to-volume conversion factors for fine, coarse, and total dust are needed and obtained from an updated, extended Aerosol Robotic Network sun photometer data analysis of the correlation between the fine, coarse and total dust volume concentration and the respective fine, coarse, and total dust extinction coefficient for all three laser wavelengths. Conversion factors (total volume to extinction) for pure marine aerosol conditions and continental anthropogenic aerosol situations are presented in addition. As a new feature of the POLIPHON data analysis, the Raman lidar method for particle extinction profiling is used to identify the aerosol type (marine or anthropogenic) of the non-dust aerosol fraction. The full POLIPHON methodology was successfully applied to a SALTRACE case and the results are discussed.

Pointwise uncertainty values are needed for modeling and data analysis and should include all the random errors affecting each data point. Total uncertainty can be decomposed into two primary components: analytical measurement uncertainty and sampling uncertainty. Analytical measurement uncertainties are relatively easy to calculate from routine quality control (QC) data. Sampling uncertainties, on the other hand, are comparatively difficult to measure. In this paper, the authors describe data from collocated samplers to provide a snapshot of whole-system uncertainty for several important chemical species. The components of uncertainty were evaluated for key species from each of the analytical methods employed by the PM^sub 2.5^ Speciation Trends Network (STN) program: gravimetry, ion chromatography (IC), X-ray fluorescence (XRF), and thermal-optical analysis for organic carbon and elemental carbon. The results show that the laboratory measurement uncertainties are typically very small compared with uncertainties calculated from the differences between samples collected from collocated samplers. These differences are attributable to the ""field"" components uncertainty, which may include contamination and/or losses during shipping, handling, and sampling, as well as other distortions of the concentration level due to flow and sample volume variations. Uncertainties calculated from the collocation results were found to be generally similar to the uncertainties currently being loaded into EPA's AQS system, with some exceptions described below.

Data analysis is carried out using qualitative phase diagrams computed on the basis of Takens–Ruelle reconstruction of attractors. Fruit stress is quantified in terms of the phase diagram area which characterizes the cyclic behaviour of temperature. Areas within the enthalpy phase diagram computed for the short sea shipping transport were 5 times higher than those computed for the long sea shipping, with coefficients of variation above 100 % for both periods. This new methodology for data analysis highlights the significant heterogeneity of thermohygrometric conditions at different locations in the container.","https://www.proquest.com/docview/2410775425?accountid=44943&bdid=84593&_bd=5AsECakqdrja1UXovr7mfBw495I%3D","https://doi.org/10.1007/s11947-013-1191-8"

What is less clear are the factors influencing the distribution of virus-specific lineages. Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) is the most important etiologic agent of epidemic encephalitis worldwide, and is primarily maintained between vertebrate reservoir hosts (avian and swine) and culicine mosquitoes. There are five genotypes of JEV: GI-V. In recent years, GI has displaced GIII as the dominant JEV genotype and GV has re-emerged after almost 60 years of undetected virus circulation. JEV is found throughout most of Asia, extending from maritime Siberia in the north to Australia in the south, and as far as Pakistan to the west and Saipan to the east. Transmission of JEV in temperate zones is epidemic with the majority of cases occurring in summer months, while transmission in tropical zones is endemic and occurs year-round at lower rates. To test the hypothesis that viruses circulating in these two geographical zones are genetically distinct, we applied Bayesian phylogeographic, categorical data analysis and phylogeny-trait association test techniques to the largest JEV dataset compiled to date, representing the envelope (E) gene of 487 isolates collected from 12 countries over 75 years. We demonstrated that GIII and the recently emerged GI-b are temperate genotypes likely maintained year-round in northern latitudes, while GI-a and GII are tropical genotypes likely maintained primarily through mosquito-avian and mosquito-swine transmission cycles. This study represents a new paradigm directly linking viral molecular evolution and climate.","https://www.proquest.com/docview/1432990842?accountid=44943&bdid=84593&_bd=P26j2CiHw%2Fk9fxPrOT9fDZK6Tek%3D","https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pntd.0002411"

Volatiles were analysed by headspace solid-phase microextraction, gas chromatography-mass spectrometry and multivariate statistical data analysis. Clear-cut differences in the volatile profiles were found. Fully ripe air-freighted pineapples were characterised by elevated concentrations of two 1,3,5,8-undecatetraene isomers, methyl 3-methylbutanoate and 4-methoxy-2,5-dimethyl-3(2H)-furanone, which have been reported as potent contributors to the pineapple flavour. Compared to fully ripened fruits, development of volatiles of sea-freighted pineapples upon arrival in Europe was rudimentary. Post-harvest storage of sea-freighted pineapples resulted in a different volatile profile due to the genesis of hydroxylated and acetoxylated methyl esters and hexanal. Subsequent descriptive sensory analysis was performed by trained panellists comparing retronasal odour and taste profiles. Fully ripe fruits were characterised by a pineapple-like note, fruity flavours and a sweet taste. In contrast, most of these attributes were rated at lower intensities when premature green-ripe fruits were tested. At the end of the post-harvest period, sea-freighted pineapples were characterised by fruity notes accompanied by a musty/corky- and cardboard-like off-flavour.

In other words, determining the right ship operating costs is the key to the success of the shipping business. Vessel operating costs are determined by direct and indirect operational costs. Direct operational costs include capital costs, insurance costs, insurance premiums, crew costs, fuel costs, lubricant costs, grease costs, fresh water costs, port costs and Repair, Maintenance, Supply (RMS) costs. The indirect operational costs include branch office costs and admin costs. Calculation of ship operating costs can actually be done manually, but it will take a lot of time. So, we need a way to calculate the operational costs of ships that are easy and efficient. In this study we developed an application to calculate ship operating costs. Then we call this application a simulator. From the simulations carried out, the results obtained that the results of calculations using the simulator are the same as the results of manual calculations, namely the total cost in rupiah. The advantage of this simulator is that it saves calculation time, so that the results obtained are easier and more efficient.

This study aimed to develop a robust clinical pharmacodynamic (PD) assay to measure the on-target PD effects of the selective PI3K inhibitor GDC-0941 in MM patients.Methods: We conducted an in vitro  drug wash-out study to evaluate the feasibility of biochemical approaches in measuring the phosphorylation of S6 ribosomal protein (S6), one of the commonly used PD markers for PI3K pathway inhibition. We then developed a 7-color phospho-specific flow cytometry assay, or phospho flow assay, to measure the phosphorylation state of intracellular S6 in bone marrow aspirate (BMA) and peripheral blood (PB). Integrated mean fluorescence intensity (iMFI) was used to calculate fold changes of phosphorylation. Assay sensitivity was evaluated by comparing phospho flow with Meso Scale Discovery (MSD) and immunohistochemistry (IHC) assays. Finally, a sample handling method was developed to maintain the integrity of phospho signal during sample shipping and storage to ensure clinical application.Results: The phospho flow assay provided single-cell PD monitoring of S6 phosphorylation in tumor and surrogate cells using fixed BMA and PB, assessing pathway modulation in response to GDC-0941 with sensitivity similar to that of MSD assay. The one-shot sample fixation and handling protocol herein demonstrated exceptional preservation of protein phosphorylation. In contrast, the IHC assay was less sensitive in terms of signal quantification while the biochemical approach (MSD) was less suitable to assess PD activities due to the undesirable impact associated with cell isolation on the protein phosphorylation in tumor cells.Conclusions: We developed a robust PD biomarker assay for the clinical evaluation of PI3K inhibitors in MM, allowing one to decipher the PD response in a relevant cell population. To our knowledge, this is the first report of an easily implemented clinical PD assay that incorporates an unbiased one-shot sample handling protocol, all (staining)-in-one (tube) phospho flow staining protocol, and an integrated modified data analysis for PD monitoring of kinase inhibitors in relevant cell populations in BMA and PB. The methods described here ensure a real-time, reliable and reproducible PD readout, which can provide information for dose selection as well as help to identify optimal combinations of targeted agents in early clinical trials.","https://www.proquest.com/docview/1326784219?accountid=44943&bdid=84593&_bd=O0Z0i1AFagnEsc8Pc4kQjpxSY40%3D","https://doi.org/10.1186/1479-5876-11-76"

Replicas of individual barnacles and barnacle colonies, and living colonies were studied in a 5 m seawater flume using tracer dyes, macro video-photography and image digitization and in a small flume fitted with differential pressure sensors. Using replicas, colonization densities were manipulated to determine the dynamics of complex barnacle populations. These techniques enabled the quantification of drag, boundary layers and their interrelationships with mean flow velocity and population density. These data show that mean stream velocity affected the size and magnitude of the boundary layer and that at higher velocities the flow over the height at which the cirri were operating was decreased proportionally greater than at low mean stream velocities. The effect on flow velocity over the cirri with increased boundary layer at higher mean stream velocities was assessed and an optimum mean stream velocity for flow over cirri identified. Density of barnacles was shown to have an effect on the flow characteristics over the population, with flow changing from independent flow at low densities, through interactive flow to skimming flow at higher densities. Drag was also shown to be affected by barnacle density. The economic impact of barnacle fouling on the world maritime fleet is estimated and discussed.","https://www.proquest.com/docview/2663845735?accountid=44943&bdid=84593&_bd=34kOpUVJ3KPSXjDQ2230Ew2YBuo%3D","https://doi.org/10.1023/A:1017088317920"

An on-demand mapping service is a chain of several consecutive steps leading to a target map that precisely meets the needs and requirements of a user.

To establish a vessel scheduling model, accurate ship maneuvering models should be used to optimize the strategy and maximize the economic benefits. The use of nonparametric modeling techniques to identify ship maneuvering systems has attracted considerable attention. The Gaussian process has high precision and strong generalization ability in fitting nonlinear functions and requires less training data, which is suitable for ship dynamic model identification. Compared with other machine learning methods, the most obvious advantage of the Gaussian process is that it can provide the uncertainty of prediction. However, most studies on ship modeling and prediction do not consider the uncertainty propagation in Gaussian processes. In this paper, a moment-matching-based approach is applied to address the problem. The proposed identification scheme for ship maneuvering systems is verified by container ship simulation data and experimental data from the Workshop on Verification and Validation of Ship Maneuvering Simulation Methods (SIMMAN) database. The results indicate that the identified model is accurate and shows good generalization performance. The uncertainty of ship motion prediction is well considered based on the uncertainty propagation technology.","https://www.proquest.com/docview/2579126778?accountid=44943&bdid=84593&_bd=FObQaZVqXb%2Fcnnl3DbDzascHOAQ%3D","https://doi.org/10.3390/jmse9080804"

External forces such as tidal currents, waves, and wind strongly influence the energy efficiency of ships. The effective management of external forces can save energy and reduce emissions. This study presents a method to build an optimal speed adjustment plan for a ship to navigate a given route. The method takes a dynamic programming (DP)-based approach to finding such an optimal plan to utilize external forces. To estimate the speed changes caused by external forces, the proposed method uses the mapping information from a combined database of ship status, marine environmental conditions, and speed changes. For the efficient manipulation of externally forced speed-change information, we used MapReduce-based operations that can handle big data and support the easy retrieval of associated data in specific situations. To evaluate the applicability of the proposed method, we applied it to real navigation situations in the southwestern sea of the Korean Peninsula. In the simulation experiments, we used real automatic identification system data and marine environmental data. The proposed method built more efficient speed adjustment plans than the fixed-speed navigation in terms of energy savings and pollutant emission reduction. The results also showed that the speed adjustment exploits external forces in a beneficial manner.","https://www.proquest.com/docview/2108543282?accountid=44943&bdid=84593&_bd=%2BISlNJ%2BzT5VvmaI8%2FnwkhM%2FFKGg%3D","https://doi.org/10.3390/en11051273"

Despite their many potential applications, a related technological challenge is realizing realistic coordinated autonomous control and decision making in complex and multi-agent environments. Machine learning approaches have been largely employed in simplified simulations to acquire intelligent control systems in multi-agent settings. However, the complexity of the physical environment, unrealistic assumptions, and lack of abstract physical environments derail the process of transition from simulation to real systems. This work presents a modular framework for automated data acquisition, training, and the evaluation of multiple unmanned surface vehicles controllers that facilitate prior knowledge integration and human-guided learning in a closed-loop. To realize this, we first present a digital maritime environment of multiple unmanned surface vehicles that abstracts the real-world dynamics in our application domain. Then, a behavior-driven artificial immune-inspired fuzzy classifier systems approach that is capable of optimizing agents’ behaviors and action selection in a multi-agent environment is presented. Evaluation scenarios of different combat missions are presented to demonstrate the performance of the system. Simulation results show that the resulting controllers can achieved an average wining rate between 52%and 98%in all test cases, indicating the effectiveness of the proposed approach and its feasibility in realizing adaptive controllers for efficient multiple unmanned systems’ cooperative decision making.

To enable SSA regardless of the vessel’s communication capabilities and context, we propose a multimodal network architecture that utilizes all of the network interfaces on a vessel, including multiple IEEE 802.11 interfaces, and automatically bootstraps the communication transparently to the applications, making the entire communication system environment-aware, service-driven, and technology-agnostic.

Deep learning (DL) is a branch of ML that has emerged in the last few years as a result of advancements in digital technology and data availability. DL has shown capacity and efficacy in tackling difficult learning tasks that were previously intractable.

A comparison of different versions of YOLO algorithms for ship detection, such as YOLOv3, YOLOv4, and YOLOv5, is presented, after training them on a personal computer with a large dataset of satellite images of the Airbus Ship Challenge and Shipsnet. The differences between the algorithms could be observed on the personal computer. We have confirmed that these algorithms can be used for effective ship detection from satellite images.

Firstly, this industry-driven study reviews both the industrial approaches to achieve CO2 emission reductions and the fuel savings and emission reductions from 500 BESS installations on various vessels. Secondly, a 630 kWh BESS retrofitted onto a hybrid-electric vessel is used to quantitively identify the improvement requirements for installations and operations. The installations required many custom designs that were expensive and have high failure risks. The standardization of interfaces’ between BESSs and vessels is thus urgently required.

Understanding the implications of the type of descriptor that is used in classification is important for feature engineering and model interpretation. However, this matter has not yet been deeply studied. This article contributes to feature engineering within this field by introducing proper similarity measures between the descriptors and defining sound benchmark classifiers, based on which we compared the predictive performance of geometric and kinematic descriptors. The performance profiles of geometric and kinematic descriptors, along with several standard tools in interpretable machine learning, helped us provide an account of how different ships differ in movement. Our results indicated that the predictive performance of geometric and kinematic descriptors varied greatly, depending on the classification problem at hand. We also showed that the movement of certain ship classes solely differed geometrically while some other classes differed kinematically and that this difference could be formulated in simple terms. On the other hand, the movement characteristics of some other ship classes could not be delineated along these lines and were more complicated to express. Finally, this study verified the conjecture that the geometric–kinematic taxonomy could be further developed as a tool for more accessible feature selection.","https://www.proquest.com/docview/2700779656?accountid=44943&bdid=84593&_bd=dxeiERzXHnjOeJW8HDuMnsCSgBc%3D","https://doi.org/10.3390/s22155588"

The storage and transport of liquefied natural gas (LNG) takes place under cryogenic conditions with substantial volume reduction due to significant storage efficiency. Consequently, there are specific requirements for the mechanical properties of the applied materials at cryogenic temperatures. The materials used so far have been cold-hard, high-nickel austenites, and martensitic steels of the X8Ni9 type. The austenitic materials offer good processing properties, but due to their comparatively low strength and high costs, these materials are not attractive. In contrast, the welding of the martensite has a significant negative impact on the processing quality and the automation of the process. In order to address the problems of automation, material costs, and mechanical properties, particularly high strength and cold toughness, the application of innovative austenitic steels with a medium as well as a high manganese content is suggested. For the qualification of medium manganese austenites as a substitute for maritime applications, the welding processing of an X2CrMnNiN17-7–5 (1.4371) is considered under the aspects of the standards and guidelines of the International Association of Classification Societies (IACS), the International Maritime Organization (IMO) and the classification society Det Norske Veritas (DNV).

The addition of 4% nitrogen into the shielding gas caused a diffusion-induced increase in the nitrogen content of the weld metal and a simultaneous increase in strength. Additionally, there were no negative influences on the austenitic microstructure.

Combined optimization of neural network fault diagnosis methods for analog circuits on ships. In: Zheng, C.W.; Wang, Q.; Zhan, C., and Yang, S.B. (eds.), Air-Sea Interaction and Coastal Environments of the Maritime and Polar Silk Roads. Journal of Coastal Research, Special Issue No. 99, pp. 158–164. Coconut Creek (Florida), ISSN 0749-0208.With increasing automation, electronic systems are becoming more widely used on ships. When electronic systems fail, it will greatly affect the safety of ship operation or even cause catastrophic accidents. Therefore, it is necessary to diagnose a circuit fault in order to repair the equipment in time. In electronic systems, more than 80% of the faults come from analog circuits. To obtain better fault diagnosis accuracy for analog circuits, neural network classification algorithms are often combined with optimization steps, such as circuit feature collection, feature engineering, regularization and so on, significantly affecting the accuracy of the classification algorithm, such as circuit feature collection, feature engineering, and regularization. However, the accuracy of analog circuit fault diagnosis is often not high in practical applications because of the tolerance of analog circuit components and other factors. To solve the above problems, this paper proposes a neural network combination optimization method based on hypothesis testing and applies it this method to the fault diagnosis of analog circuits on ships. This method uses hypothesis testing to combine and sort the optimization methods of each step in a neural network classification algorithm to obtain a model ranking based on the accuracy rate with mathematical statistics rules, thereby obtaining the optimal combination method. Finally, the validity of the method is verified by experiments.","https://www.proquest.com/docview/2814779404?accountid=44943&bdid=84593&_bd=ifTiyhuwPjPqZPp6GXfoENeafo4%3D","https://doi.org/10.2112/SI99-023.1"

Whereas hacking is often seen as taking control of a ship, or part of a ship, it is also related to the alteration of the sensors, the PLCs, the data logger or the SCADA systems. This alteration can be done from a hacking group but in the investigated case, it is more likely an action triggered either by the ship owner, or the ship manufacturer himself.

"Modeling the ecologic niche of plague in sylvan and domestic animal hosts to delineate sources of human exposure in the western United States","","Walsh, Michael; MA Haseeb","PeerJ","Scholarly Journals","","","","2015-12-14","Dec 14, 2015","n/a","","","21678359","","","ENG","Plague has been established in the western United States (US) since 1900 following the West Coast introduction of commensal rodents infected with Yersinia pestis via early industrial shipping. Over the last century, plague ecology has transitioned through cycles of widespread human transmission, urban domestic transmission among commensal rodents, and ultimately settled into the predominantly sylvan foci that remain today where it is maintained alternatively by enzootic and epizootic transmission. While zoonotic transmission to humans is much less common in modern times, significant plague risk remains in parts of the western US. Moreover, risk to some threatened species that are part of the epizootic cycle can be quite substantive. This investigation attempted to predict the risk of plague across the western US by modeling the ecologic niche of plague in sylvan and domestic animals identified between 2000 and 2015. A Maxent machine learning algorithm was used to predict this niche based on climate, altitude, land cover, and the presence of an important enzootic species, Peromyscus maniculatus. This model demonstrated good predictive ability (AUC = 86%) and identified areas of high risk in central Colorado, north-central New Mexico, and southwestern and northeastern California. The presence of P. maniculatus, altitude, precipitation during the driest and wettest quarters, and distance to artificial surfaces, all contributed substantively to maximizing the gain function. These findings add to the known landscape epidemiology and infection ecology of plague in the western US and may suggest locations of particular risk to be targeted for wild and domestic animal intervention.","https://www.proquest.com/docview/1958170476?accountid=44943&bdid=84593&_bd=9%2FzNaIhrUpL7MUpoXgn2%2FsUp%2Bqo%3D","https://doi.org/10.7717/peerj.1493"

It is of particular concern to the international shipping industry because it increases fuel costs and presents a biosecurity risk by providing a pathway for non-indigenous marine species to establish in new areas. There is growing interest within jurisdictions to strengthen biofouling risk-management regulations, but it is expensive to conduct in-water inspections and assess the collected data to determine the biofouling state of vessel hulls. Machine learning is well suited to tackle the latter challenge, and here we apply deep learning to automate the classification of images from in-water inspections to identify the presence and severity of fouling. We combined several datasets to obtain over 10,000 images collected from in-water surveys which were annotated by a group biofouling experts. We compared the annotations from three experts on a 120-sample subset of these images, and found that they showed 89% agreement (95% CI: 87–92%). Subsequent labelling of the whole dataset by one of these experts achieved similar levels of agreement with this group of experts, which we defined as performing at most 5% worse (p =0.009–0.054). Using these expert labels, we were able to train a deep learning model that also agreed similarly with the group of experts (p =0.001–0.014), demonstrating that automated analysis of biofouling in images is feasible and effective using this method.","https://www.proquest.com/docview/3079613046?accountid=44943&bdid=84593&_bd=6CsZ8kKLJkgATjnnmA5EdXs7vb0%3D","https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-021-81011-2"

Meanwhile, a growing number of ship-reporting technologies and remote-sensing systems are generating an overwhelming amount of spatio-temporal and geographically distributed data related to large-scale vessels and their movements. Individual technologies have distinct limitations but, when combined, can provide a better view of what is happening at sea, lead to effectively monitor fishing activities, and help tackle the investigations of suspicious behaviors in close proximity of managed areas. The paper integrates non-cooperative Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) Sentinel-1 images and cooperative Automatic Identification System (AIS) data, by proposing two types of associations: (i) point-to-point and (ii) point-to-line. They allow the fusion of ship positions and highlight “suspicious” AIS data gaps in close proximity of managed areas that can be further investigated only once the vessel—and the gear it adopts—is known. This is addressed by a machine-learning approach based on the Fast Fourier Transform that classifies single sea trips. The approach is tested on a case study in the central Adriatic Sea, automatically reporting AIS-SAR associations and seeking ships that are not broadcasting their positions (intentionally or not). Results allow the discrimination of collaborative and non-collaborative ships, playing a key role in detecting potential suspect behaviors especially in close proximity of managed areas.","https://www.proquest.com/docview/2550451171?accountid=44943&bdid=84593&_bd=dw64gKu%2BxUqHUYHTPAZBUeiklo8%3D","https://doi.org/10.3390/s21082756"

The maritime domain is no different as all larger vessels are obliged to be equipped with a vessel tracking system that transmits their location periodically. Consequently, automated methodologies able to extract meaningful information from high-frequency, large volumes of vessel tracking data need to be developed. The automatic identification of vessel mobility patterns from such data in real time is of utmost importance since it can reveal abnormal or illegal vessel activities in due time. Therefore, in this work, we present a novel approach that transforms streaming vessel trajectory patterns into images and employs deep learning algorithms to accurately classify vessel activities in near real time tackling the Big Data challenges of volume and velocity. Two real-world data sets collected from terrestrial, vessel-tracking receivers were used to evaluate the proposed methodology in terms of both classification and streaming execution performance. Experimental results demonstrated that the vessel activity classification performance can reach an accuracy of over 96%while achieving sub-second latencies in streaming execution performance.","https://www.proquest.com/docview/2531127993?accountid=44943&bdid=84593&_bd=T6d8H4i%2FoZ%2B8PXifVHfF72EKrVg%3D","https://doi.org/10.3390/ijgi10040250"

The lidar observations were performed at Barbados during the Saharan Aerosol Long-Range Transport and Aerosol-Cloud-Interaction Experiment (SALTRACE) in the summer of 2014. The POLIPHON method comprises the traditional lidar technique to separate mineral dust and non-dust backscatter contributions and the new, extended approach to separate even the fine and coarse dust backscatter fractions. We show that the traditional and the advanced method are compatible and lead to a consistent set of dust and non-dust profiles at simplified, less complex aerosol layering and mixing conditions as is the case over the remote tropical Atlantic. To derive dust mass concentration profiles from the lidar observations, trustworthy extinction-to-volume conversion factors for fine, coarse, and total dust are needed and obtained from an updated, extended Aerosol Robotic Network sun photometer data analysis of the correlation between the fine, coarse and total dust volume concentration and the respective fine, coarse, and total dust extinction coefficient for all three laser wavelengths. Conversion factors (total volume to extinction) for pure marine aerosol conditions and continental anthropogenic aerosol situations are presented in addition. As a new feature of the POLIPHON data analysis, the Raman lidar method for particle extinction profiling is used to identify the aerosol type (marine or anthropogenic) of the non-dust aerosol fraction. The full POLIPHON methodology was successfully applied to a SALTRACE case and the results are discussed. We conclude that the 532 nm polarization lidar technique has many advantages in comparison to 355 and 1064 nm polarization lidar approaches and leads to the most robust and accurate POLIPHON products.","https://www.proquest.com/docview/1940025850?accountid=44943&bdid=84593&_bd=exT7f8xCWNnRN%2FsHVVUKEQQAnXY%3D","https://doi.org/10.5194/amt-10-3403-2017"

In this paper, we compare a long short-term memory (LSTM) method and a seasonal autoregressive integrated moving average (SARIMA) method for forecasting the comprehensive and route-based Shanghai Containerized Freight Index (SCFI). The research findings indicate that the LSTM deep learning models outperformed SARIMA models in most of the datasets. For South America and the east coast of the U.S. routes, LSTM could reduce forecasting errors by as much as 85% compared to SARIMA. The SARIMA models performed better than LSTM in predicting freight movements on the west and east Japan routes. The study contributes to the literature in four ways. First, it presents insights for improving forecasting accuracy. Second, it helps relevant parties understand the trends of container freight markets for wiser decision-making. Third, it helps relevant stakeholders understand overall container shipping market trends.

Dense sea fogs reduce visibility at sea and have frequently caused ship collisions. This study used a geographically weighted regression (GWR) model to explore the spatial non-stationarity of near-miss collision risk, as detected by a vessel conflict ranking operator (VCRO) model from automatic identification system (AIS) data under the influence of sea fog in the Bohai Sea. Sea fog was identified by a machine learning method that was derived from Himawari-8 satellite data. The spatial distributions of near-miss collision risk, sea fog, and the parameters of GWR were mapped. The results showed that sea fog and near-miss collision risk have specific spatial distribution patterns in the Bohai Sea, in which near-miss collision risk in the fog season is significantly higher than that outside the fog season, especially in the northeast (the sea area near Yingkou Port and Bayuquan Port) and the southeast (the sea area near Yantai Port). GWR outputs further indicated a significant correlation between near-miss collision risk and sea fog in fog season, with higher R-squared (0.890 in fog season, 2018), than outside the fog season (0.723 in non-fog season, 2018). GWR results revealed spatial non-stationarity in the relationships between-near miss collision risk and sea fog and that the significance of these relationships varied locally. Dividing the specific navigation area made it possible to verify that sea fog has a positive impact on near-miss collision risk.","https://www.proquest.com/docview/2963013493?accountid=44943&bdid=84593&_bd=z9zv7fPR98Ps7B1UPGiRKMQ4RzM%3D","https://doi.org/10.1007/s13131-022-2137-7"

We investigated and assessed options related with the integration of multiple data sources (SAR L- and C-band, optical indexes and spatial texture indexes from Sentinel-1, Sentinel-2 and ALOS-PALSAR-2), feature extraction, feature selection and machine learning techniques. On our test case, we found that the combination of multiple open access data sources has synergistic benefits on the forest parameters estimates. The sensibility analysis shows that all the data participate to the improvements, that reach up to 13.7% when compared to single source estimates. Accuracy of the estimates is as follows: aboveground biomass (AGB) 28% relative RMSE, basal area (BA) 27%, diameter at breast height (DBH) 20%, age 17%, tree density 24%, and height 13%. Forward feature selection and SVR provided the best estimates. Future work will focus on validating this generic approach in different settings.

In this paper, we study reducing order fulfillment cost by order consolidation. Motivated by the observation that a significant percentage of buyers place multiple orders within a short time interval, we propose a scheme that attempts to consolidate such ""multiorders"" to reduce the number of parcels and hence, the shipping cost. At the same time, it cannot significantly disturb the existing order fulfillment process or undermine the customer service level. Successful execution of the scheme requires a prediction of multiorder probabilities and a control policy that selectively prioritizes order processing. For the prediction task, we formulate a binary classification problem and use machine-learning algorithms to predict in real time the probability of a multiorder. For the control task, our proposal is to hold arriving orders in a temporary order pool for potential consolidation and to determine the release timing by a dynamic program.

This requires simultaneous processing of the input sequences and generation of the response sequences. The automatic identification system (AIS) encounter data mainly include the time-series data of two AIS sets, which exhibit a one-to-one mapping relation. Herein, an encoder–decoder automatic-response neural network is designed and implemented based on the sequence-to-sequence (Seq2Seq) structure to simultaneously process the two AIS encounter trajectory sequences. Furthermore, this model is combined with the bidirectional long short-term memory recurrent neural networks (Bi-LSTM RNN) to obtain a network framework for processing the time-series data to obtain ship-collision avoidance decisions based on big data. The encoder–decoder neural networks were trained based on the AIS data obtained in 2018 from Zhoushan Port to achieve ship collision avoidance decision-making learning. The results indicated that the encoder–decoder neural networks can be used to effectively formulate the sequence of the collision avoidance decision of the USV. Thus, this study significantly contributes to the increased efficiency and safety of maritime transportation. The proposed method can potentially be applied to the USV technology and intelligent collision-avoidance systems.","https://www.proquest.com/docview/2548683279?accountid=44943&bdid=84593&_bd=SH1ow0nVOCFlOQsPfAaPKw%2FKCMg%3D","https://doi.org/10.3390/jmse8100754"

In view of these challenges, this research proposes a methodology for the creation of a port infrastructure asset management tool, generated based on the Design Science Research Method (DSRM), in line with Building Information Modeling (BIM) and digitization trends in the infrastructure sector. The proposal provides workflows and recommendations for the survey of port infrastructures from UAVs, the reconstruction of digital models by photogrammetry (due to scarce technical documentation), and the reconstruction of BIM models. Along with this, the bidirectional linking of traditional asset management spreadsheets with BIM models is proposed, by visual programming, allowing easy visualization of the status and maintenance requirements.

This study evaluates greenhouse gas (GHG) reduction alternatives and their combined ability to decarbonise international transport. Liquefied natural gas (LNG) is becoming widely used, reducing CO2 emissions by 20–30 percent, while it has similar action in other emissions such as SOX. Although costs are attractive, methane slip, which depends on the engine type, reduces GHG gains. Replacing conventional fuels such as heavy fuel oil and marine diesel oil with alternative ones is an effective method to decrease SOx emissions. Liquefied natural gas is highly appreciated as an alternative fuel for maritime transportation. In this frame, the possibility of using alternative fuels, such as LNG, to reduce NOx, CO2 and SOx emissions in Heraklion Port, including certain regionally defined waters, over the life of the vessel will also be explored. The study is conducted for ships calling at Heraklion Port and using alternative fuel such as LNG in different modes (cruising, hotelling, manoeuvring). A fuel-based emission reduction factor, rEif, is defined in relation to the comparison of two different fuels: conventional (heavy oil, marine diesel) and alternative fuels (LNG). The bottom-up method is used for this data analysis. This study, by defining the reduction of several emissions with the use of LNG, indicates that it is actually an efficient transitional fuel to lead international transport to decarbonisation.","https://www.proquest.com/docview/2756818332?accountid=44943&bdid=84593&_bd=b1Edok%2FhNXW2EBiAgeEfTrveFhA%3D","https://doi.org/10.3390/su142416364"

Optimizing ship routes is economically important for ship operation, but it is also essential to meet the standards of environmental regulations recently imposed by the International Maritime Organization. For this purpose, various algorithms for determining ship routes have been developed to ensure the economical operation of ships via utilization of marine climate data and Automatic Identification System (AIS) data. However, such algorithms require a large amount of computational time and do not provide optimal routes because they do not consider practical operating conditions, such as weather and ocean conditions. In this study, an improved A* algorithm using AIS and weather data is proposed to overcome the limitation of the original A* algorithm, one of the most widely used path-finding algorithms. The improved A* algorithm uses an adaptive grid system that efficiently explores nodes according to map grid deformation by latitude. It finds economical routes by minimizing the estimated time of arrival generated by machine learning through 16-way node exploration. For verification of the proposed method, the original A* algorithm and improved A* algorithm were compared through a case study.","https://www.proquest.com/docview/2440177330?accountid=44943&bdid=84593&_bd=AxQ1LpO6K7mhJtTza9S8BAOKwyM%3D","https://doi.org/10.3390/app10176010"

In the marine IoT system, many unmanned surface vehicles (USVs) are deployed to monitor the marine environment in a coordinated manner. Moreover, multiple USVs cooperatively transmit the sensory data via wireless channels to the onshore base station (OBS) for estimating the marine environment. Due to the limited transmit power, large transmission distance, complex maritime wireless environment, the transmission throughput and transmission reliability of sensory data could not be guaranteed, which will deteriorate the environment monitoring performance. In order to solve this problem, this paper investigates a multi-UAV assisted cooperative transmission to maximize the total throughput under the constrained of outage probability, transmit power and available channels. In particular, we firstly analyze the achievable transmission reliability of the USV-OBS link, since the marine environment monitoring application has a certain requirement for the outage probability. Then, we optimize the total transmission throughput under the requirement of outage probability by jointly optimizing the USV-UAV association and the transmit power control. Finally, a heuristic algorithm is designed to effectively and efficiently solve the 0 − 1 integer programming problem. Simulation results show that the proposed heuristic algorithm could obtain the near-optimal solution with low computational complexity.","https://www.proquest.com/docview/2562654374?accountid=44943&bdid=84593&_bd=vUip2N%2F0cd7I2J9ZaMu9BKvm0EE%3D","https://doi.org/10.1007/s12083-021-01129-y"

Results demonstrate that the classifications of vessel types based on their SAR signatures are highly efficient, with maximum accuracies of 96.16%, 92.7%, and 93.59%, when training using noise-free, noisy, and denoised datasets, respectively.

These data have long been used but not yet extensively. In this paper, MEDiterranean International Trawl Survey (MEDITS) data was supplemented with 18 layers of information related to major environmental (e.g. depth, sea water and wind velocity, sea waves) and anthropogenic (e.g. river inputs, shipping lanes, urban areas and ports, fishing effort) forcings that influence seafloor macro-litter distribution. The Random Forest (RF), a machine learning approach, was applied to: i) model the distribution of several litter categories at a high spatial resolution (i.e. 1 km²); ii) identify major accumulation hot spots and their temporal trends. Results indicate that RF is a very effective approach to model the distribution of marine macro-litter and provides a consistent picture of the heterogeneous distribution of different macro-litter categories. The most critical situation in the study area was observed in the north-eastern part of the western basin. In addition, the combined analysis of weight and density data identified a tendency for lighter items to accumulate in areas (such as the northern part of the Tyrrhenian Sea) with more stagnant currents.

Machine learning is well suited to tackle the latter challenge, and here we apply deep learning to automate the classification of images from in-water inspections to identify the presence and severity of fouling. We combined several datasets to obtain over 10,000 images collected from in-water surveys which were annotated by a group biofouling experts.

Subsequent labelling of the whole dataset by one of these experts achieved similar levels of agreement with this group of experts, which we defined as performing at most 5% worse (p =0.009–0.054).

The establishment of a National Security Commission (NSC) in November 2013, the power centralization in the Central Military Commission (CMC) and the reorganization of the CCP leadership of the People's Liberation Army (PLA) as well as the major branches of the PLA, the reorganization in March 2013 of the various civilian maritime security agencies and the establishment in December 2013 of a Cybersecurity and Informatization Leading Small Group (LSG) are the most striking organizational reforms introduced by Xi. But other institutional changes have taken place as Xi's inclination to rely on a larger number of actors and in particular to give his closer political allies a bigger role also in foreign and security policy. These changes have obviously helped concentrate more power in the hands of Xi Jinping and, to some extent, better coordinate domestic and external security objectives and on the whole have well served China's foreign and security policy's assertiveness and initiatives. However, these changes have only partly reduced the power fragmentation that has developed extensively under Hu Jintao, and they have not contributed to institutionalizing decision-making processes at the top of the CCP and the state apparatuses.

In this paper, we proposed a payment system based on “smart contract” implemented on top of blockchain technology to minimize risks for parties. The platform consists of a set of rules that each party must follow including specific delivery time and place, cost of delivery, mortgage money; thereby, forcing parties to be responsible for their tasks in order to complete the contract. We also provided a detailed implementation to illustrate the efficiency of our model.","https://www.proquest.com/docview/2656387007?accountid=44943&bdid=84593&_bd=60radR2%2F3m08TGnhtwOX8oDSKuA%3D","https://doi.org/10.14569/IJACSA.2019.0100405"
"Valuation of the Extension Option in Time Charter Contracts in the LNG Market","","Lim, Sangseop; Chang-hee, Lee; Chang-hee, Lee; Won-Ju, Lee; Choi, Junghwan; Jung, Dongho; Jeon, Younghun","Energies","Scholarly Journals","","15","18","2022-01-01","2022","6737","","","19961073","","","ENG","A rapid transition toward a decarbonized economy is underway, following the Paris Agreement and the International Maritime Organization 2030 decarbonization goals. However, due to the high cost of the rapid transition to eco-friendly energy and the geopolitical conflict in eastern Europe, liquefied natural gas (LNG), which emits less carbon than other fossil fuels, is gaining popularity. As the spot market grows due to increased LNG demand, the usage of period extension options in time charter (T/C) contracts is increasing; however, these options are generally provided free of charge in practice, without economic evaluation; this is because some shipowners want to make their time charter contracts more attractive to the more credible charterers. Essentially, the reason for why this option has not been evaluated is because there is no reliable evaluation model currently used in practice. That is, research on the evaluation model for the T/C extension option has been insufficient. Therefore, this study evaluates the economic value of the extended period option in LNG time charter contracts using machine learning models, such as artificial neural networks, support vector machines, and random forest, and then compares them with the Black–Scholes model that is used for option valuations in financial markets. The results indicate superior valuation performance of the random forest model compared with the other models; particularly, its performance was significantly better than the Black–Scholes model. Since T/C extension options involve significant sums in the balance sheets of both shipowners and charterers, the fair value of these options should be assessed. In this regard, this paper has meaning in proposing valid machine models to efficiently reflect the fair value of period extension options that are provided at no charge in the LNG market.","https://www.proquest.com/docview/2716534646?accountid=44943&bdid=84593&_bd=SEZ3cMktS0jmNb47ERYSckPeYQY%3D","https://doi.org/10.3390/en15186737"

At present, commonly used ZTD forecasting models comprise empirical, meteorological parameter, and neural network models. The empirical model can only fit approximate periodic variations, and its accuracy is relatively low. The accuracy of the meteorological parameter model depends heavily on the accuracy of the meteorological parameters. The recurrent neural network (RNN) is suitable for short-term series data prediction, but for long-term series, the ZTD prediction accuracy is clearly reduced. Long short-term memory (LSTM) has superior forecasting accuracy for long-term ZTD series; however, the LSTM model is complex, cannot be parallelized, and is time-consuming. In this study, we propose a novel ZTD time-series forecasting utilizing transformer-based machine-learning methods that are popular in natural language processing (NLP) and forecasting global ZTD, the training parameters provided by the global geodetic observing system (GGOS). The proposed transformer model leverages self-attention mechanisms by encoder and decoder modules to learn complex patterns and dynamics from long ZTD time series. The numeric results showed that the root mean square error (RMSE) of the forecasting ZTD results were 1.8 cm and mean bias, STD, MAE, and R 0.0, 1.7, 1.3, and 0.95, respectively, which is superior to that of the LSTM, RNN, convolutional neural network (CNN), and GPT3 series models. We investigated the global distribution of these accuracy indicators, and the results demonstrated that the accuracy in continents was superior to maritime space transformer ZTD forecasting model accuracy at high latitudes superior to that at low latitude. In addition to the overall accuracy improvement, the proposed transformer ZTD forecast model also mitigates the accuracy variations in space and time, thereby guaranteeing high accuracy globally. This study provides a novel method to estimate the ZTD, which could potentially contribute to precise GNSS positioning and meteorology.","https://www.proquest.com/docview/2694029364?accountid=44943&bdid=84593&_bd=VBmUU9p64wnEAr9tylzE5NHlFR4%3D","https://doi.org/10.3390/rs14143335"

This paper categorizes the security threats according to three processing levels: abnormal activities, behaviors, and intents, and presents available machine learning techniques to detect these threats, including several deep learning techniques which is the current trend in detecting abnormalities. Supervised learning and unsupervised learning techniques used in the literature are discussed in this paper, where the advantages and disadvantages of each approach in the context of maritime surveillance are discussed in detail. Supervised learning was used predominantly for detecting relatively simple abnormal behaviors and intents such as movement abnormalities. Such learning methods yielded higher accuracy values in comparison to unsupervised learning methods, which achieved 80–95% accuracy. Supervised learning methods perform between 93 and 99% accuracy, where the highest accuracy is achieved by SVM (support vector machine) and 91% accuracy by CNN (convolutional neural network) as the best among deep learning methods.

In this context, different institutional strategies and voluntary initiatives by coastal communities were implemented in order to better manage marine resources. According with blue economy and blue growth models, the European regulatory framework strongly affects the member countries through the Common Fisheries Policy (CfP), underlining that economic growth of maritime activities cannot ignore the environmental and ecological aspects. In Italy, the Ministry of Agriculture, Food and Forestry Policies (MiAFFP) carries out supplementary measures in order to improve the competitiveness of fisheries with three-year national plans. This study evaluates the effectiveness of ten Local Management Plans (LMPs) for fishing activities recently implemented in Sicily (Italy). Monitoring of fisheries activities for the period 2012-2015 by using biological, technical, economic and social indicators, had allowed to assess each plan. Data analysis had taken into account the polyvalence and diversification of fishing activities. Results show that the implementation process of the LMPs had been very complex at every stage. Despite the innovations and the availability of the fishing communities to a strict self-management, several critical issues and weakness in strategies have emerged. Arising considerations on institutional and social sustainability domains underscore the importance of the local management to ensure long-term sustainability of the resources exploited, through the increase of accountability in resource management shared between institutions, fishers and scientists.","https://www.proquest.com/docview/2095680524?accountid=44943&bdid=84593&_bd=EKycszVNQHpvl5R9k0KC4rRKihQ%3D",""

In this work, we develop a data preparation method to clean and arrange this streaming data for analysis, including a data-driven variable selection. Data are drawn from a mining industry case study, with sensor data from a primary production excavator over a period of 9 months. Variables include 58 numerical sensors and 40 binary indicators captured in 45-million rows of data describing the conditions and status of different subsystems of the machine. A total of 57% of time stamps contain missing values for at least one sensor. The response variable is drawn from fault codes selected by the operator and stored in the fleet management system. Application to the hydraulic system, for 21 failure events identified by the operator, shows that the data-driven selection contains variables consistent with subject matter expert expectations, as well as some sensors on other systems on the excavator that are less easy to explain from an engineering perspective. Our contribution is to demonstrate a compressed data representation using open-high-low-close and variable selection to visualize data and support identification of potential indicators of failure events from multivariate streamed data.","https://www.proquest.com/docview/2647095376?accountid=44943&bdid=84593&_bd=O5lSPVE4BPqmEizAYwOJbEf6Fo8%3D","https://doi.org/10.1017/dce.2022.4"

Scaling up LNG-fueled ships is highly dependent on safe bunkering operations, particularly during simultaneous operations (SIMOPs); therefore, performing a quantitative risk assessment (QRA) is either mandated or highly recommended, and a dynamic quantitative risk assessment (DQRA) has been developed to make up for the deficiencies of the traditional QRA. The QRA and DQRA are both data-driven processes, and so far, the data of occurrence rates (ORs) of basic events (BEs) in LNG bunkering SIMOPs are unavailable.

However, a small number of them, acting maliciously, can raise many security risks. Recent Artificial Intelligence (AI) capabilities for object detection can be very useful for the identification and classification of drones flying in the airspace and, in particular, are a good solution against malicious drones. A number of counter-drone solutions are being developed, but the cost of drone detection ground systems can also be very high, depending on the number of sensors deployed and powerful fusion algorithms. We propose a low-cost counter-drone solution composed uniquely by a guard-drone that should be able to detect, locate and eliminate any malicious drone. In this paper, a state-of-the-art object detection algorithm is used to train the system to detect drones. Three existing object detection models are improved by transfer learning and tested for real-time drone detection. Training is done with a new dataset of drone images, constructed automatically from a very realistic flight simulator. While flying, the guard-drone captures random images of the area, while at the same time, a malicious drone is flying too. The drone images are auto-labelled using the location and attitude information available in the simulator for both drones. The world coordinates for the malicious drone position must then be projected into image pixel coordinates. The training and test results show a minimum accuracy improvement of 22% with respect to state-of-the-art object detection models, representing promising results that enable a step towards the construction of a fully autonomous counter-drone system.","https://www.proquest.com/docview/2579910302?accountid=44943&bdid=84593&_bd=qHALatI65YDdvZBNFSeqkGAzsho%3D","https://doi.org/10.1017/aer.2021.43"

The involvement of different maritime parties in the marine transportation flow scheduling and management further escalates these challenges. Thus, we need an IoT-based collaborative processing system that unifies the modular structure and integrates multiple modules involved in MTS. Moreover, the need for a shared and controlled access mechanism that cannot be manipulated or tampered by unauthorized parties is also essential requirement in MTS. Blockchain, as an emerging technology, has become a key tool in data security protection because of its non-tampering and non-forgery characteristics. Keeping in view of this aspect, in this paper, an IoT-based collaborative processing system based on blockchain is proposed for marine transportation flow scheduling and management. In addition, we propose a novel consensus mechanism based on Verifiable Random Function (VRF) and reputation voting to reduce the communication cost in blockchain consensus communication process. The proposed scheme has been validated in a simulated environment and the results illustrate that the scheme has obvious effect in resisting replay attack and camouflage attack. Furthermore, the optimized consensus mechanism improves the security by 8% and the transaction processing speed by 6% on the premise that the communication cost is basically unchanged.","https://www.proquest.com/docview/2774333648?accountid=44943&bdid=84593&_bd=yWNpjMT%2F9RS4SkZjbINJ%2Bva5gOI%3D","https://doi.org/10.1109/TITS.2022.3159485"

Because the comprehensive operational security of modern MTS is not yet mature, historical transportation data of the Maritime Silk Road are acquired and preprocessed. Afterward, DTs are introduced, and relay nodes are added to data transmission paths to construct a maritime transportation DTs model based on relay cooperation IoT. Eventually, this model’s security performance is validated through simulation experiments. Relay security analysis suggests that interference information is a vital guarantee to assist in information non-disclosure, from which the constructed model can harvest energy to increase the data transmission power, thereby improving communication performance and secrecy rate. Outage probability analysis reveals that the simulated and the theoretical results are almost the same; moreover, given the system’s multi-hop paths in the same environment, the more the relays and the greater the fading index, the better the system performance and the lower the outage probability. Once the iterations reach a particular number, the node secrecy rate becomes optimal and cannot cause excessive burden to the system; besides, the power distribution can establish a new equilibrium when the nodes are in different locations, so that system security performance gets improved. The simulated value is closest to the actual result under 100% successful transmission probability and [Formula Omitted] value. To sum up, the constructed maritime transportation DTs model presents extraordinary transmission and security performance, providing an experimental basis for intelligent and secure maritime transportation in the future.","https://www.proquest.com/docview/2774334219?accountid=44943&bdid=84593&_bd=vLo2p%2FvqeX3%2BuBwBMo6fmQTcIgQ%3D","https://doi.org/10.1109/TITS.2021.3122566"

Establishing low-cost, flexible genotyping platforms in small, public and regional laboratories can stimulate the application of molecular breeding in developing countries. These laboratories can serve plant breeding projects requiring low- to medium-density markers for marker-assisted selection (MAS) and quality control (QC) activities.Methods: We performed two QC and MAS experiments consisting of 637 maize lines, using an optimised genotyping workflow involving an in-house competitive allele-specific PCR (KASP) genotyping system with an optimised sample collection, preparation, and DNA extraction and quantitation process. A smaller volume of leaf-disc size plant samples was collected directly in 96-well plates for DNA extraction, using a slightly modified CTAB-based DArT DNA extraction protocol. DNA quality and quantity analyses were performed using a microplate reader, and the KASP genotyping and data analysis was performed in our laboratory.Results: Applying the optimized genotyping workflow expedited the QC and MAS experiments from over five weeks (when outsourcing) to two weeks and eliminated the shipping cost. Using a set of 28 KASP single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) validated for maize, the QC experiment revealed the genetic identity of four maize varieties taken from five seed sources. Another set of 10 KASP SNPs was sufficient in verifying the parentage of 390 F1 lines. The KASP-based MAS was successfully applied to a maize pro-vitamin A (PVA) breeding program and for introgressing the aflatoxin resistance gene into elite tropical maize lines.Conclusion: This improved workflow has helped accelerate maize improvement activities of IITA's Maize Improvement Program and facilitated DNA fingerprinting for tracking improved crop varieties.

Meeting"";9 rejection of contracts;10 classification of claims and interests;11 a payment-priority scheme;12 a plan of reorganization13 with voting by creditors14 and cramdown;15 avoidance of fraudulent transfers;16 and recovery of preferences.17 The EBL, however, is shorter and far less detailed than the Bankruptcy Code.18 Lawyers and judges we interviewed voiced frustration with the brevity and vagueness of the EBL.Depending on the location or size of the debtor, a bankruptcy case may originate in either of the three provincial courts.21 The EBL does not provide for specialized bankruptcy courts, and the gem eral lack of expertise in bankruptcy by people's court judges is considered to be one reason that bankruptcy is underutilized in China.22 To help remedy this lack of expertise, the Supreme People's Court has directed provinces to establish at least one court that specializes in bankruptcy.23 Three cities now have designated bankruptcy courts, including Shenzhen, Beijing, and Shanghai,24 and other courts have created bankruptcy divisions within their court systems.25 People's courts take an active role in the filing, negotiations, management, and resolution of bankruptcy cases.""26 If a bankruptcy application is accepted, the court selects the bankruptcy administrator,27 approves the members and chairman of the ""Creditors' Meeting,""28 and, if a creditors' committee is appointed, approves the members of the committee.29 The court approves agreements, resolves creditor claims and other disputes,30 and approves the liquidation distribution31 or the reorganization plan.32 In addition, the court may order a cramdown if creditors reject a proposed reorganization plan.33 In addition to the responsibilities set forth in the EBL, courts are tasked with practical functions such as helping to procure tax incentives from local government agencies to encourage new investment and facilitating clean-up of credit reports of reorganized debtors by communicating with governmental agencies.34 In addition, courts are directed to establish ""communication and coordination mechanisms"" between the bankruptcy administrator and relevant governmental agencies to resolve any difficulties in formulating the plan of reorganization.35 A national website for information on bankruptcy cases has been established,36 but many courts have developed their own online bankruptcy platforms.Launched in the spring 2019, it allows for integrated communication and management by the court and the bankruptcy administrator of all aspects of a case, including account balances, review and analysis of creditor claims, document filing, sales of assets, and blockchain collaboration among relevant players.37 With the encouragement of the Supreme People's Court, bankruptcy judges in China have started using web-based platforms to market bankruptcy assets.38 For years, banks and asset managers have used a number of approved online exchanges to auction nonperforming loans.39 Recently, however, courts are turning to China's popular retail platform, Taobao.40 Owned by multinational e-commerce behemoth Alibaba,41 Taobao, similar to Amazon, is best known for its exhaustive array of consumer goods, with next-day shipping.[...]as in the United States, Chinese courts may order substantive consolidation if the debtor entities are essentially a single unit.44 A creditor may file an involuntary application against a debtor for the same reasons.45 The debtor must be notified of a creditor's filing within five days and may contest the filing within seven days, but no penalty is imposed on the filing creditor if the application is not accepted.46 This contrasts with involuntary proceedings in the United States, which may be initiated by three or more creditors with total claims of $15,775.47 The alleged debtor in an involuntary proceeding may contest the filing,48 and the creditors might be required to pay the debtor's related costs if the involuntary case is dismissed based on the debtor's opposition.49 Data from 2007 to 2015 indicates that approximately thirty-one percent of cases in China are filed by creditors.50 A Chinese bankruptcy case does not commence until it has been accepted by the court.","https://www.proquest.com/docview/2439143861?accountid=44943&bdid=84593&_bd=Bc6EUU%2F2nY0SQhHn2A53dAKIFZI%3D",""

In addition, the poster specified the theoretical assumptions, attributes, antecedents, and consequences of motivation.In today's increasingly complex health care environment, the role of the nurse requires extensive education in the sciences and humanities as well as higher order thinking abilities to meet current health care demands. In the United States, three types of programs provide entry-level education into the nursing profession: associate, diploma, and baccalaureate. These programs differ in required education content, primarily regarding liberal education, community health nursing, and nursing theory and research. Recent research shows that these differences in education, particularly between associate and baccalaureate programs, affect the quality of nursing practice, compromise client health and safety, inhibit professional advancement in nursing, and impact the current and projected nursing shortage. Such research indicates that pursuing a higher degree in nursing may alleviate these problems. Each generation's motivational factors should be considered to understand what motivates each generation of nurses to return to school.Since 2002, the World Trade Center Medical Monitoring & Treatment Program (WTCMMTP) has assessed workers and volunteers for health conditions related to their work at the World Trade Center (WTC) site. On the 10th anniversary of the attacks, this literature review sought to summarize the early and most recent studies examining respiratory symptoms and conditions among WTC workers and volunteers. Of the 37 articles published between 2002 and 2010 through the WTCMMTP, 18 articles reported on workers' and volunteers' respiratory symptoms and conditions. Occupational health nurses from the WTCMMTP reviewed studies and summarized findings related to respiratory status. A high proportion of WTC workers and volunteers reported increased incidence or worsening of lower or upper respiratory symptoms after their work at the site. Spirometry results indicated low forced vital capacity, obstruction, and mixed obstruction/restriction patterns. One identified risk factor for increased incidence or worsening of respiratory symptoms, poor spirometry results, and respiratory conditions was early arrival to the WTC site. Workers and volunteers had increased incidence or worsening of the following conditions after WTC occupational exposure: asthma, reactive airway dysfunction syndrome, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, interstitial lung diseases, rhinitis, sinusitis, pharyngitis, laryngitis, and sleep apnea. WTC workers and volunteers are reporting new incidence or worsening of respiratory symptoms and conditions following work at the WTC site. No current data suggest increased incidence of pulmonary or upper respiratory cancers, but continued monitoring is needed to determine the long-term effects of this occupational health exposure.Workplace bullying has been linked to a myriad of adverse psychological and physical outcomes for both experienced and novice nurses who have been the target of this negative behavior. These outcomes include shame, self-blame, absenteeism, intent to leave, burnout, stress, and avoidance. Novice nurses are at high risk for these outcomes if workplace bullying is not prevented (Hutton & Gates, 2008; McKenna, Smith, Poole, & Coverdale, 2003; Pellico, Brewer, & Kovner, 2009; Simmons, 2008; Vessey, Demarco, Gaffney, & Budin, 2009). Yet, a fundamental gap in the workplace violence literature exists about the relationship of work productivity and workplace bullying against novice nurses. The purpose of this study was to describe the problem of workplace bullying against novice nurses and their resultant change in work productivity. The specific aims for this study were to (1) determine the prevalence and frequency of workplace bullying, (2) determine the change in work productivity of novice nurses following a workplace bullying incident, and (3) identify the relationship of novice nurse characteristics (age, gender, and educational attainment) to workplace bullying and resulting work productivity. The National Occupational Research Agenda (NORA, 2009) identified the need for research focused on psychosocial factors, interpersonal conflict, and work-related violence. Understanding the prevalence and frequency of workplace bullying and its relationship to work productivity is an essential step in recognizing the seriousness of workplace bullying for the mental health, physical health, and work productivity of novice nurses.This study evaluated the effect of an employer-sponsored 6-month cardiometabolic education program on hypertension awareness and control in participants with elevated blood pressure (> 120/80 mmHg). Participants received periodic educational materials and fitness, nutritional, and provider consultations. After the 6-month intervention, participants demonstrated significant improvement in hypertension awareness, a decrease in systolic and diastolic blood pressure, and improved control of hypertension.The implementation of workplace safety initiatives often signals the need for organizational change led by the occupational health nurse. Organizational change is influenced by the organization's culture, which is pivotal in determining the success of leaders' efforts to implement change. Additionally, occupational health nurses understand organizational culture because they interact with workers regularly on safety and health issues. As a leader whom employees trust, the occupational health nurse is uniquely positioned to be a change agent within the organization. Leaders' degree of cultural awareness may determine their effectiveness in facilitating organizational change. Latta's (2009) process model of organizational change in cultural context (OC Model) provides a framework for understanding the impact of organizational culture on leading change. Eight stages of cultural influence are identified in the model: cultural analysis of readiness, shaping vision, informing change initiatives, reflecting culture in implementation strategies, embodying cultural intent, cultural mediation of implementation, moderating outcomes of change, and documenting collateral effects. It is hypothesized that occupational health nurses may benefit from recognizing Latta's (2009) stages of cultural influence on organizational change and using this model to guide the design and implementation of programs aimed at creating a healthy workplace environment.Nurses at a veteran's hospital were confronted with providing care to soldiers with severe debilitating injuries resulting from a variety of exploding devices. Additionally, many had symptoms of traumatic brain injuries (TBI) in combination with other disabling conditions, including amputations, burns, fractures, and hearing and visual impairments. Caring for these patients placed many nurses at risk for symptoms of occupational stress. A program was established employing a mental health nurse liaison (MHNL) counselor to provide support services for nurses at risk for occupational stress. The evaluation of the MHNL was based on evidence gleaned from the literature and an analysis of the MHNL's contacts and activities from June 2008 through June 2010. The source of the categories for the analysis template was the International Society of Psychiatric Consultation Liaison Nursing's 10 core elements. Contact/activity logs were reviewed and analyzed. Requests for services came from three sources: nurse self-referral, nurse managers/nursing administrators, and non-nursing staff. Overall, 482 requests for services were received and categorized using the 10 core elements. One third of the visits related to personal issues that impacted work performance and two thirds related directly to work issues such as communication, boundaries, and interpersonal conflict. To meet the needs of employees at risk for occupational stress, hospitals should offer annual educational programs related to boundaries, communication, prevention of conflict, and employee relations. A research study could also be conducted to assess nursing staff's knowledge, recognition, and management of high stress levels. Finally, hospitals could develop programs that identify the signs and symptoms of stress in nurses and other personnel.To protect patients, employees' family members, and the community from influenza infection in November 2009, a health care organization implemented a mandatory influenza immunization policy. All employees, contracted clinical personnel, and volunteers were required, as a condition of employment, to be immunized against influenza each year. This policy included, but was not limited to, those with and without direct patient care or contact. All vaccination programs are coordinated through the Occupational Health Department, so department staff were confronted with the task of planning, implementing, and enforcing for the first time an unpopular mandatory immunization program during the 2009 flu season. The 2009 season required two vaccines for full protection, the H1N1 and Seasonal Flu.Blue-collar workers experience a wide range of exposures to occupational hazards. The purpose of this study was to assess the burden of exposures to occupational hazards among building trades workers. The researchers conducted a cross-sectional survey with more than 1,800 apprentices (mean age = 29 years; 95% male, 82% White) from 10 union sites in Massachusetts. The survey contained questions on various occupational hazards, including chemicals, dust, work-related musculoskeletal problems (e.g., awkward postures, repetitive hand motion, high hand force), and psychosocial job stress. Cross-tabulations were calculated for each occupational exposure variable and each building trade. The most commonly reported exposure was dust (53%), followed by chemicals (31%) and highly repetitive hand motion (31%). Workers reported more than 4 hours of awkward neck postures (23%), back (21%), shoulder (19%), and knee (19%), and 18% reported more than 4 hours of gripping an object weighing more than 10 pounds. About 20% reported they felt highly pressured to take shortcuts in safety practices. The majority (83%) reported at least one significant occupational exposure, and nearly half (44%) reported high exposures to more than three hazards. The extent of exposures differed by building trades: highest dust exposure was reported by plumbers (71%); highest chemical exposure was reported by pipe fitters (48%); and highest awkward shoulder posture was reported by sprinkler fitters (49%). Construction workers reported exposures to multiple occupational hazards. More research is needed to assess the impact of occupational exposures on workers' health and safety and design of interventions that address these exposures.Because of the nature of the job, firefighting is a dangerous career. Firefighters work in situations that can cause bodily harm or death; however, they are also asked to work between periods of time that are highly stressful and physically demanding, and periods of time that are sedentary and inactive. This work schedule can place additional stress on their cardiovascular system and cause them harm. In fact, the combination of the above mentioned situations may increase the prevalence of death due to cardiovascular disease in firefighters, which is higher than the prevalence of death due to cardiovascular disease in the general public. In the general American population, one in four deaths is attributable to cardiovascular disease (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention [CDC], 2010); among firefighters, approximately two in five deaths are attributable to cardiovascular disease. Perhaps not coincidentally, life expectancy for firefighters is 5 to 9 years below the national average (CDC, 2010; Drew-Nord, Hong, & Froelicher, 2009; Hilyer, Brown, Sirles, & Peoples, 1990). These statistics are alarming and have resulted in the establishment of specific goals to reduce firefighters' cardiovascular risk factors (National Fire Protection Association [NFPA], 2010, National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health [NIOSH], 2010; U.S. Fire Administration [USFA], 2010). Reducing cardiac risk factors, such as elevated blood pressure, increased waist circumference, body mass index, and body fat is the goal of this research study. Tai chi is a health-related fitness program that may facilitate compliance with NFPA Standard 1582 and NIOSH and USFA recommendations to reduce cardiac risk factors in that it may be beneficial to firefighters as a way to maintain an optimal level of cardiac health, as well as safely perform assigned job functions with improved balance and increased upper and lower body strength. The study will determine if tai chi has reduced health and safety risk factors for firefighters.For many years, annual N-95 fit-testing has been a cumbersome, time-consuming, costly, and often frustrating process. Functioning on a ""just in case"" basis, more than 1,000 employees were fit-tested for one possible suspected or confirmed tuberculosis patient who might be admitted to the hospital. In essence, the focus of annual fit-testing shifted from providing employees with evidence-based education regarding respiratory protection to ""just getting it done."" In 2009, a Lean Sigma team was created to guide and standardize the fit-testing process, beginning to end. This team included Occupational Health, Infection Prevention, and Safety representatives from different facilities. This poster outlined how one hospital used the guidelines set forth from the Lean Sigma team to create a focused and efficient fit-testing program. The tools used for meaningful decisions on who should be fit-tested and when were included, showing how those decisions impacted compliance, cost, and overall effectiveness of annual N-95 respiratory fit-testing.Skin cancer risks associated with workplace exposures are a concern for occupational health nurses. Skin cancer is the most common of all cancers and was estimated at more than 2 million new cases in 2010 (American Cancer Society). Screenings offered to participants at an agricultural fair demonstrated a need for more providers prepared to evaluate skin lesions. It is difficult to identify dermatologists available for these clinics, and alternative specialty providers are needed. This project describes research to alleviate this provider shortage and is the first phase in the creation of a user-friendly educational program for nurses. A researcher-developed survey was mailed to 178 graduates of a nurse practitioner (NP) program in the geographic area served by the clinic; 73 surveys were returned. The survey asked for demographic, knowledge, and attitudinal data from the NPs, who worked in a variety of settings. Data analysis is ongoing, consisting of descriptive statistics and associations among knowledge, practice, and attitudes. Preliminary findings have shown that respondents are primarily female, only 29% answered all knowledge items correctly, 47% felt prepared to conduct competent skin assessment, 81% included occupational history in new patient assessments, and 6% used technology as a first resource. Occupational health nurses, using evidence-based practice, can be primary educators with at-risk workers, and can provide skin screening opportunities at worksite events and industry-focused conventions. Use of technology, combined with nurses' increased competence in skin assessment, optimizes early identification and treatment of skin cancer.Costs associated with injuries among patient care providers continue to rise. After an assessment of injury factors, a hospital invested $800,000 in a minimal lift mechanical equipment program designed to promote ease of sliding, transfer, and positioning of patients. Equipment included ceiling lifts for 75% of patient beds, slide sheets, and standing and ambulation aids for individuals requiring limited assistance as well as those who are semi-dependent and totally dependent. Prospective survey research and a retrospective chart review were conducted after Institutional Review Board approval. Reviewed retrospectively were consequences of and costs to treat patient care providers sustaining patient handling injuries. Injury rates decreased from 24 per 1,000 staff to 22.2 per 1,000 staff. Average total cost per injury decreased by $139.26. From an evidence-based practice perspective, the results from this study support inclusion of the lift equipment program on hospital units for which the lift equipment has not yet been purchased.As a novice to occupational health nursing and an expert in mental health nursing, the presenter examined the case for combining the two specialties to benefit both employee and employer. Employees meeting the challenges of a mental health diagnosis are often left to manage their own illness with little support and understanding from employers. Workers diagnosed with severe mental illness and receiving disability are often the recipients of extensive job coaching. In contrast, individuals diagnosed with a mental illness and marginal functionality but employed have to contend with the network of psychiatric treatment without support. The presented case study analyzed the effectiveness of case management using solution-focused therapy and motivational interviewing techniques to facilitate successful work interventions in a large academic health care facility. An evaluation tool to measure the progress and perception of employees in this setting is needed. Psychosocial Vital Signs (PVS), another tool, was developed for use in an academic setting to teach nursing students to quickly assess clients' needs and communicate those needs and health status changes from a holistic viewpoint. PVS does not have established reliability and validity, but use in occupational health settings may demonstrate its value in assessing not only employees with mental health needs but also employees returning to work. The case study is a demonstration of such use.The leading causes of vision impairment and blindness in the United States are primarily age-related eye diseases. With Americans living longer and the aging of baby boomers, the number of Americans with these conditions--age-related macular degeneration, cataracts, diabetic retinopathy, and glaucoma--and resulting vision impairment is expected to double within the next three decades (Prevent Blindness America, 2008). Unfortunately, the availability of qualified professionals who can treat and provide support for the devastating impact of vision loss has not kept pace with the escalating demand. To address this need, Lighthouse International has developed an online, comprehensive, accessible curriculum to cross-train health care practitioners in related disciplines, particularly occupational health nurses, providing specialized knowledge and skills needed to support the safety, independence, and employment of the growing number of adults with vision loss. This Mult-E-Skills curriculum covers specific performance-based skills and critical decision-making proficiencies in vision rehabilitation therapy, low vision care, and orientation and mobility. The refined version of the prototype curriculum will be launched nationwide as a stand-alone low vision rehabilitation training course that will reflect the needs of occupational health nurses and prepare them to work with adults experiencing vision loss, thereby alleviating the social and economic impact of this growing problem.Hispanic workers represent a large and growing segment of the worker population and present unique challenges when they are injured at work. This poster discussed the influence of Hispanic culture on worker behaviors and issues related to injured Hispanic workers. The poster also presented successful occupational health nursing approaches to returning Hispanic workers to their jobs.As a medical center employee health nurse for the past 12 years, it has been my privilege to serve and encourage prevention of influenza through annual vaccinations. Influenza vaccination rates were found to be consistent with Centers for Disease Control and Prevention rates between 2005 and 2006. However, the team sought to improve these rates, preventing the spread of influenza in the hospital setting. Medical center vaccination history demonstrated it was necessary to consider other strategies to implement a change. Nurses developed a plan to educate the staff regarding influenza and pneumococcal vaccination and then compare the vaccine rates the following season. Once implemented, the nurses worked to vaccinate a large number of staff in a short period and compare vaccine rates after implementing this new approach. The nurses compared the numbers of vaccinations pre- and post-implementation and noted a significant improvement in influenza vaccination rates. The medical center did experience a small but noteworthy decrease in vaccination rates in 2009--2010, so the program was re-energized. This program could serve as a benchmark for other facilities committed to preventing the spread of influenza.The average age of registered nurses is around 46 years (NSSRN, 2008). Approximately 50,000 of these nurses work for insurance companies, which are increasingly allowing nurses to work from home. Little is known about how to reduce the inherent health and safety risks of isolated, static computer work for 8 hours a day. This descriptive exploratory study surveyed 37 at-home nurses (66% participation) about their work comfort. A baseline survey reported extensive discomfort in the neck, low back, shoulders, and wrists. Interventions included education, ergonomic strategies, and yoga to reduce the risk of musculoskeletal discomfort. Following these interventions, a significant increase in stretching (12%), and non-significant monitor adjustments were made and a significant decrease (25%) in wrist pain and back pain (12%) were measured, and a non-significant decrease (7%) in leg pain. Nurses and managers may see at-home work as physically easier than bedside nursing. However, nurses and managers should recognize the dangers of at-home work and implement strategies to minimize these hazards.Annual vaccination against influenza is widely recognized as the most effective means of preventing influenza infection. Despite the recognized value of influenza vaccination, many health care workers are reluctant to be vaccinated against influenza or, for a number of reasons, fail to do so. Nationally, only 62% of all health care workers are vaccinated against influenza each year despite access to vaccine. This poster detailed how a large academic medical center, employing approximately 21,000 employees and staff, increased its influenza vaccination rate among health care workers. For the 2010--2011 influenza season, the medical center attained an employee influenza vaccination rate greater than 80% and a rate among direct care providers of approximately 90%. The primary strategies included a centrally located and visible employee flu vaccine clinic held during a 1-week period, use of peer vaccinators who were trained as ""flu champions"" in patient care areas (i.e., clinical staff vaccinated one another), and walk-in visits to the Occupational Health Service. In addition, the hospital implemented a ""mask policy"" that requires unvaccinated employees and staff to wear a surgical mask when providing care to hospitalized patients or working in their rooms. When providing care in an outpatient setting, a mask must be worn when providing care within 3 to 6 feet of the patient. Employees and staff required to wear a mask were identifiable to managers as they were not provided with a sticker for their badge indicating they were vaccinated employees and staff.Assessing occupational hazards in international work sites presents unique challenges due to varying legal requirements, management commitment to occupational health and safety, cultural differences, and the availability of control mechanisms. The goal of this program was to implement an occupational safety process based on the needs of a charity hospital in India. During the summer of 2010, the author worked as a student occupational health nurse consultant at a 60-bed charity hospital in Agra, India. The hospital housed three operating theaters, a 26-bed emergency department, and a thriving outpatient department. In preparation for this internship, the author conducted a literature review of common occupational hazards to Indian hospital staff and legal requirements for occupational health services in Indian health care facilities. Once on-site, the author observed work practices in all units over the course of a week. In discussing these observations and the literature review with hospital administrators, they requested assistance in complying with biohazard waste laws and sharps disposal. The author created a sharps disposal program that incorporated signage, training, and disposable puncture-resistant containers. Because no budget was available for this control program, the system was created using empty IV bottles and fastened metal containers to buttress them in place. Anticipating occupational hazards helped to determine prioritization, and personal observations and collaboration with hospital administrators and staff led to a creative program to reduce injuries among hospital staff.A review of occupational health records revealed a steady increase in employees' weights and glucose and lipid results. Although wellness programs had been in place for several years, a decrease in participation by employees coincided with natural attrition and a renewed company focus on performance. Discussions with senior management regarding unfavorable health changes among many employees and increased health care expenses related to these changes resulted in a 12-week program designed to motivate employees to exercise and lose weight. Monetary incentives were approved to encourage participation. Fasting full executive laboratory panels were drawn at the beginning and end of the 12 weeks. At the initial appointment, employees' weight, height, body mass index, and waist circumference were recorded. Participants were required to use food and exercise diaries, which the occupational health nurse reviewed with each participant and made suggestions as needed. One hundred eighteen employees enrolled in the program. At week 12, 45 active participants had lost between 10 and 38 pounds each, with a company total weight loss of 968 pounds. Blood chemistry results improved as well. A post-program questionnaire confirmed that company incentives did motivate participation. Additional motivators were realistic personal goals, occupational health nurse-led nutrition education, and weekly monitoring of exercise and eating patterns.The mission statement of the American Red Cross indicates that it is a humanitarian organization led by volunteers and guided by its Congressional Charter and the fundamental principles of the International Red Cross Movement. It provides relief to victims of disaster and helps people prevent, prepare for, and respond to emergencies. As a volunteer-led organization, many rules and regulations that would apply to a traditional work force (employer/employee) do not apply to the American Red Cross Disaster Services Human Resource (DSHR). However, the Red Cross has chosen to be proactive in protecting its greatest asset, its volunteers. The Red Cross uses thousands of everyday people to fulfill its mission, individuals who have their own set of health-related issues. Knowing this, the DSHR developed and uses a process of screening volunteers prior to deployment. This process is designed to promote health and minimize the risk of injury to individuals while assigned to a disaster relief operation.This poster introduced animal-assisted therapy in health care, presented anecdotal and formal findings about the effects of a therapy dog on health care workers, and offered occupational health nurses a literature review. As documented in the literature, the presence of pets provides non-evaluative social support critical to buffering physiological responses to stress. Pleasurable stimuli offered at the time of psychological distress can alleviate distress and discomfort through various mechanisms. Attachment theory proposes that individuals become attached to those who are sensitive and responsive in social interactions with them. The authors speculated that a therapy dog, available consistently over time, could fill this role. When the hospital initiated an animal-assisted therapy program in 2008 in response to patients' requests and supported by related literature, it was hoped hospital staff might also benefit. Clinical and nonclinical staff encountering a therapy dog appeared to derive pleasure and relief from the work-related stress attributed in part to the effects of prolonged compassion fatigue after caring for seriously ill patients. Staff often need assistance in handling the potentially negative effects of their caring; hence, the authors developed a formal research project to investigate the effects of employee-therapy dog interactions. The authors compared the impact on employees' blood pressure and self-reported stress from 1) a session with the therapy dog, 2) training in a HeartMath stress-reduction practice, and 3) the opportunity to relax as the employee chose.The purpose of this study was to determine the effectiveness of an educational intervention in the work setting to increase end-of-life discussions and the execution of advanced directives. A descriptive design study was undertaken at a local bottling company after institutional review board approval. An educational intervention based on the Five Wishes  document was presented. A pre-program questionnaire measured a lack of knowledge and understanding about end-of-life planning and advanced directives. A post-program questionnaire measured an increase in knowledge and understanding about end-of-life planning and advanced directives. A focus group was conducted with audio recording for participants to describe personal experiences. The quantitative analysis used statistical procedures to describe and synthesize data and content analysis was used to understand the focus group data. A sample of 78 participants was questioned 1) about their knowledge of advanced directives, 2) whether or not they would consider executing an advanced directive, 3) whether or not they were likely to discuss end-of-life care with others, 4) whether they would be comfortable having someone make end-of-life decisions on their behalf, and 5) whether or not they believed that advanced directives were important; the majority of participants indicated that they strongly agreed or agreed with each question. However, when the same participants were asked the same questions after the educational portion of the study, comparison of the pre- and post-program questionnaire mean scores revealed a significant increase. The study demonstrated that workplace education regarding advanced directives can foster end-of-life discussions and increase the number of individuals who execute advanced directives.This poster reflected occupational health nurses' practice in the field of safety, including nurses conducting accident investigations and ergonomic and safety assessments; managing safety programs; maintaining Occupational Safety and Health Administration logs and monitoring recordkeeping; recommending engineering controls; performing noise area monitoring; assisting with personal protective equipment selection and training; assisting with respiratory protection, including selection, fit-testing, and training; and participating on safety committees.The Occupational Safety and Health Administration's Voluntary Protection Program (VPP) was developed to improve worker safety. It requires teamwork and cooperation from all company sectors. A successful program requires management, safety, labor, and occupational health and safety working together to develop an integrated injury-reduction plan. Employee participation in the planning and implementation of the program is critical to success. Participants are evaluated on the implementation of the plan and its effectiveness in reducing injuries. In cooperation with another site's participants, the occupational health department at a major defense industry contractor in Tucson, Arizona, has had three successful certifications and a recertification in the past 3 years. This poster provided an overview of the history and process of VPP as well as the requirements for successful implementation of VPP. Examples of the costs and benefits of participation were presented. A sample time line for the application and implementation process and preparation for the rigorous audit were also included. Important lessons learned from these audits and a list of implementation resources were provided. VPP is rewarding and has been shown to reduce workplace injuries. The VPP ""days away and restricted time"" rate is now 52% lower than comparable businesses. Tools and best practices based on the team's successful experiences may encourage other occupational health departments to develop their own VPP.The agricultural industry relies on physical labor. Ergonomic risks from agricultural work activities can compromise the health and well-being of workers. This study examined the prevalence of upper extremity pain in a sample representing almost 2 million U.S. agriculture industry workers. Estimates of shoulder, elbow, and wrist/hand pain prevalence were calculated using National Health Interview Survey data from 2004 to 2008. Agricultural workers were defined as individuals who currently worked in crop production or animal production or supported agricultural activities. Weighted prevalences were compared between agricultural workers and other industry workers (22 groups) and these data were also examined by demographic and employment characteristics. Adjusted prevalence ratios were calculated using the SUDAAN Loglink program with Poisson distribution assumptions. The monthly prevalence of pain in upper extremities among agricultural workers was 17.3%. Compared with other industry workers, agricultural workers showed the highest prevalence of shoulder pain, and ranked third and fourth for elbow and wrist/hand pain, respectively. Among agricultural workers, significant associations were found between shoulder pain and age and between elbow pain and type of agricultural industry/occupation, after adjustment for demographic and employment characteristics. More detailed prevalence data for upper extremity pain by demographic and employment characteristics were also presented. The prevalence of upper extremity pain is higher for agricultural workers than other industry workers. Interventions and education for risk factor reduction and proper management of symptoms should be targeted to agricultural workers.An occupational health outpatient department, part of a comprehensive health care network, includes one of the nation's largest multi-specialty group practices, regional community clinics, and a hospital. Frequently, the department receives calls from employers concerned about their employees' ability to safely engage in assigned job functions. A fitness-for-duty examination is required to assess the safety and health of the employee. This poster defined, listed the types of, and explained the parameters of a fitness-for-duty evaluation. Also included were providers' expectations of the employer and vice versa. Last, several case studies were presented.Firefighters face many health and safety risks due to the nature of their work. In addition to job risks, Smith's (2001) analysis identified myocardial infarction as the leading cause of on-duty death among firefighters in the United States. A review of firefighter fatalities from 1995 to 2001 in collaboration with the National Fire Protection Association revealed that 43% of on-duty firefighter fatalities were the result of sudden cardiac death (Fahy, 2005). According to Staley (2008), research and health promotion programs targeting cardiovascular risk reduction in firefighters are most effective if implemented in the context of the firefighters' culture. Staley (2008) suggested that, ""characterizing fitness within firefighter culture in terms of the values, beliefs, and assumptions held from the firefighter's perspective could yield valuable information for improving the design and implementation of physical fitness interventions, as well as sustaining worksite program adherence and improved physical fitness levels"" (p. 21). Rogers, Larkey, and Keller (2010) found that tai chi combines physical movement and deep breathing that results in a state of relaxation, reducing stress and improving inner peace. This tai chi research study is a longitudinal, repeated measures study to evaluate the effects of a 10-week tai chi program on cardiovascular risk factors among firefighters. The tai chi study incorporates Bandura's social learning theory as the theoretical framework.Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is a common condition known to cause excessive sleepiness. A study by Pack et al. (2002) found 28% of commercial drivers have some degree of OSA. Truck driving is a hazardous occupation, with the third highest fatality rate among all occupations in the United States. The Large Truck Crash Study found that half of all crashes resulted in fatal or incapacitating injuries. The truck driver was judged to be at fault in 87% of crashes. Only 4% occurred because the driver was incapacitated by myocardial infarction, cerebrovascular accident, or hypoglycemia--yet these conditions are the primary focus of the CDME examination. Tools to identify a driver's risk for OSA include the Mallampati Scale, the Epworth Sleepiness Scale, body mass index, and neck circumference in inches. Published consensus criteria could assist health care providers to identify at-risk drivers and recommend polysomnogram testing. This testing could protect the long-term health of drivers and ensure public safety. The lack of health insurance for pre-placement examinations is a barrier to diagnosis and treatment of drivers at risk for OSA.With the U.S. work force experiencing more health-related problems, including personal illnesses and injuries that require long-term acute and non-acute care, it appears that companies must institute innovative health and wellness programs to keep their work force healthy and free of injury. What is the occupational health nurse's role in planning, implementing, and evaluating health and wellness programs? Will these programs result in increased worker productivity, decreased injuries and absenteeism, and an improved bottom line for the company? What interventions should the occupational health nurse implement to convince management that workplace wellness is important, and what will motivate employees to participate in company wellness programs? This poster provided some sobering statistics, evidence-based program strategies, and positive outcomes for a successful wellness workplace.The Pharmaceutical Nurse Scope of Practice Project  identified the occupational health nursing skill sets, knowledge, and scope of practice necessary to function safely and effectively in a pharmaceutical business environment. Specialized knowledge of the drug development process, beginning with early discovery, manufacturing, and the commercialization of the finished product is defined. It is necessary for the occupational health nurse working in the pharmaceutical industry to monitor the health and safety of employees involved in industry processes. Monitoring is especially critical, as many exposures to new molecular entities (NMEs) are not fully characterized. The project was chartered to identify practice demands and was completed with collaboration from industrial hygienists, toxicologists, health and safety specialists, and global health professionals. The resulting document is a reference for nurses entering the pharmaceutical sector, the occupational health nurse currently working in the pharmaceutical sector, and nurses working with an integrated campus model. This resource can help nurses identify potential risks and hazards, the nurse's role in the process, necessary actions, and partners to ensure the health and safety of those working in the pharmaceutical environment. No other reference of this type currently exists to guide occupational health nurses as they address the complex risks and hazards inherent in the pharmaceutical industry.According to the U.S. Fire Administration (2011), approximately 100 on-duty firefighters are killed and tens of thousands are injured each year. Occupational hearing loss is the most common occupational disease and is the second most self-reported occupational illness or injury. A few studies reported hearing loss as a risk factor for occupational injury among various worker groups, but no study involved firefighters. The purpose of this study was to investigate a relationship between hearing loss and occupational injury among firefighters. A total of 237 firefighters in three states participated in the study. The study used a computerized survey including demographic and work-related questions, perceptions of hearing loss, and history of occupational injury and work, and an audiogram. Participants were middle age (mean = 44 years), male (94%), and White (88%) firefighters with many years (mean = 17) in fire services. Audiogram results showed about 35% of the participants had high frequency hearing loss. Approximately 65% reported an occupational injury; 52% of them with no-duty and 47% with modified duty. More than 90% of firefighters said hearing loss can contribute to occupational injuries or safety risks. A significant relationship between high frequency hearing loss and occupational injury (t  = 2.18, p  = .031) was noted; firefighters with poorer hearing reported more injuries. Hearing loss was significantly associated with occupational injury among firefighters. Hearing protection should be an integral part of intervention strategies to reduce injuries and accidents among firefighters.Europe and the United States, with their diverse work forces, currently have transitional work programs that provide individualized comprehensive injury care. In the past 8 years, companies, from top management to all ranks of labor, have accepted these programs. These programs integrate claims administration with health care management, bill paying, vocational rehabilitation services for job reassignment, and return to work initiatives. The interim steps in the physical recovery of an injured worker emphasize real work as the principal means of physical and mental recovery. Each employee is compensated by returning to full duty employment or job reassignment. Current research has shown that the return to work of injured workers is critical to the long-term prospect of their remaining in the work force. Large economic gains can be realized by the implementation of a transitional work program in a global work environment.The purpose of this review was to determine if the use of immunizations, risk stratification, and appropriate antibiotics reduce the incidence of hospitalizations and deaths associated with community-acquired pneumonia (CAP). Evidence-based guidelines for risk stratification and empiric antibiotic selection based on American Thoracic Society/Infectious Diseases Society of America guidelines were highlighted. The Health Care Utilization Project  (HCUP) database was used to identify specific rates of hospitalizations for bacterial pneumonia between 1997 and 2007 by accessing data published on HCUPnet and HCUP Facts and Figures 2007. A literature review was completed to identify current recommended outpatient care to prevent hospitalizations. A retrospective review of the data available on HCUPnet showed a decrease in the rate of hospitalizations for CAP from 1997 to 2007. Indeed prevention, risk stratification, and the judicious use of antibiotics have contributed to a decrease in pneumonia hospitalization rates. Evidence-based guidelines for treatment of CAP were identified and risk stratification tools discussed, along with a treatment guideline tool adapted from American Thoracic Society/Infectious Diseases Society of America guidelines for outpatient care. Occupational health advanced practice clinicians are often on the front lines and have the means to prevent and treat CAP earlier in the disease process, improving worker outcomes and health care costs.Workplace bullying continues to be problematic in health care. Seventy percent of the participants in a U.S. nursing survey reported being bullied at work (Vessey, Demarco, Gaffney, & Budin, 2009). Nationally, 40% of bullied individuals leave their jobs because of workplace bullying (Workplace Bullying Institute, 2007). With the predicted demand for nurses and the costs associated with orientation and replacement, the profession cannot afford to lose nurses to bullying. The purpose of this pilot study was to determine the effectiveness of a cognitive rehearsal program in decreasing workplace bullying. The descriptive study involved pilot survey testing, survey analysis, a training program, and a 6-month post-program survey. Of the 62 staff nurses on the medical and surgical units of two rural hospitals asked to participate, 20 completed the survey and 15 joined the training. Initially, participants completed a piloted survey about the bullying behaviors they had experienced. Nurses then participated in a 2-hour cognitive rehearsal training program where they learned responses to common bullying behaviors. The program consisted of information about workplace bullying and cognitive rehearsal techniques and their application and practice. Knowledge retention was measured using a pre-test/post-test study design. The 6-month post-program survey to measure bullying encounters will be completed this fall. The results showed 80% of the nurses surveyed had experienced workplace bullying. From the cognitive rehearsal program, a significant increase in workplace bullying management knowledge from pre-test to post-test was found (p< .01).Health care workplace bullying is a significant problem worldwide. A significant number of nurses experience workplace bullying and many even quit their jobs as a consequence of the bullying. The purpose of this pilot research study was to determine the frequency of workplace bullying and to evaluate the effectiveness of cognitive rehearsal in responding to common bullying behaviors by increasing staff nurses' knowledge about workplace bullying management. This descriptive, quasi-experimental study consisted of three components: (a) a pilot Internet-based survey, (b) an Internet-based survey, and (c) a 2-hour cognitive rehearsal training program to manage workplace bullying. Of the 62 medical and surgical nurses of two affiliated rural hospitals eligible to participate, 20 completed the survey and 15 joined the training program. The results of the study showed 80% of the nurses surveyed had experienced workplace bullying; nursing peers were identified as the major source of workplace bullying. Additionally, nurses' workplace bullying management knowledge significantly increased after the training session. The difference between nurses' reports that they had observed bullying, had bullied others, and felt adequately prepared to handle workplace bullying was significant pre to post program. The study implications included the need for a specific organizational workplace bullying policy and a program to learn cognitive responses to common bullying behaviors.Health care workers are placed at occupational risk for influenza, and pose a risk of transmitting influenza to patients vulnerable to illness complications. Seasonal influenza vaccination is the most effective method to prevent influenza transmission, but health care worker vaccination rates remain suboptimal. This study examined the 2009--2010 seasonal influenza vaccination records of workers at a large multi-site ambulatory care group to determine if demographic attributes were predictors of vaccination status. This quantitative retrospective record review used a comparative descriptive design for data analysis. The study sought to discover 1) the average rate of vaccination for the study sample; 2) the health care workers' vaccination status by demographic characteristic; and 3) whether health care workers in particular demographic groups are more likely to decline the vaccine or fail to participate in the vaccination program. The sample included 2,401 clinic-based health care workers. During the study period, the organization experienced a 49.2% vaccination acceptance rate, but a 34.1% non-participation rate. Of those who participated, 74.6% accepted the vaccine. Demographics, including working at large primary care clinics, being employed 4 years or less, and working as a clinician, appear to be predictors of those most likely to decline vaccination. The results revealed the importance of increasing participation rates when measuring the effectiveness of a vaccination program. Reducing the resource burden for program administration, performing outreach directly to employees, and discussing influenza vaccination during new employee orientation were key recommendations.Five years ago, a company's Outcomes-Based Care Management Program was implemented, led by occupational health nurses. This systematic approach to case management provides a framework to evaluate the through process, all steps leading to the outcome. Assessment information was used to design and implement best practices for treating injured workers. The outcome measure was disability duration. Benchmarking with the published Official Disability Guidelines,  more than 80% of high impact cases had fewer days away from work than the ""best practice"" guidelines. By linking case management efforts directly to the targeted business unit, the occupational health nurses best used their resources and demonstrated value to the organization.Nearly 9 of 10 adults have problems understanding routinely available, everyday health information, according to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. Health literacy, a term that has been gaining popularity among government groups, health care providers, and other constituents, is defined as the capacity to obtain, process, and understand basic health information and services to make appropriate health decisions. Establishing basic health literacy among today's health care consumers is key to enabling effective and efficient use of health care services, preventing and managing chronic disease, and ultimately lowering the cost of health care and improving health outcomes. Educating employees about health literacy can be a driver for better workplace health and safety. The company launched an educational campaign for employees focused on improving health literacy about diagnostic testing. The ""Know Your Numbers"" campaign launched in June 2010 to teach the basics of diagnostic testing, how the campaign should be used as part of health management, and how to interpret results to become an educated consumer. A baseline survey of employees prior to launch revealed that 80% of employees believed that health literacy was important and 84% wanted to learn more about health literacy. Post-program survey results measuring the impact of the program will be available in 2011.Globally, nurses provide most of the occupational health and safety care; however, occupational health nursing capacities are very limited. Training is often not available because in-country training programs are unavailable or unaffordable. Therefore, personnel with no formal training provide health and safety services, even in subsidiaries of global companies. The need for occupational health nursing education is significant. The global International Certificate in Occupational Health Practice  is an online training program for nurses and physicians in developing countries who provide occupational health services without formal training. The program provides practical, introductory content to develop medium-level competencies and immediately usable skills using three online, asynchronous, instructor-led courses during 9 months (total 340 hours). Teaching is in English with communication possible in French, Spanish, and German. Two full programs have been completed since August 2009 with more than 46 participants worldwide from 23 countries. Percentages from each continent are Asia, 32%, Africa, 20%, Latin and Central Americas, 34%, and United States and Europe, 12%; 37% from companies and 32% from government or semi-governmental organizations. Nurse participation is very low (17%) versus physician participation (64%). Feedback indicated acceptance and high impact of the program, varying with topic and practical applicability. Participants use course materials for workplace inspections, training, scientific projects, and presentations at scientific conferences. Nurses seem to have less support, less training opportunities, and less access to online education than physicians. Computer literacy is a more significant problem for nurses than physicians. Teaching challenges include cultural diversity of learning styles, limited Internet connections, prohibitive cost of books and shipping, and inherent limits of online delivery mode.","https://www.proquest.com/docview/915869904?accountid=44943&bdid=84593&_bd=V3tr7Zzt%2BqFmjwpY7oFHFvuIJ%2Fo%3D","https://doi.org/10.1177/216507991105900701"

In order to do this, a thorough review of those premises was performed, from one of the first experiences in 1991 (Denmark), to the recently implemented and proposed in the UK, defining its main characteristics (acting maritime climate, the correlation between wave height and period associated with a given recurrence) and the type of protection used (weight average, nominal diameter in the case of breakwater type protection, width and behavior). Taking into consideration the experience with offshore wind farms in current operation, the design data analysis, the basis of climate and the soil-structure interaction, the dimensionless wave height parameter (H0), the erosion extension (Lext), and the quantification of maximum scour depth (Smax) have been calibrated for a preliminary design of protections around a large diameter pile, obtaining initial values for H0 in the vicinity of 6 and 15, and values for the extension of protection design between L/4 and L/2.","https://www.proquest.com/docview/1681905484?accountid=44943&bdid=84593&_bd=GjL%2B6ifTKKKh%2BeKwRGxWluu3O0w%3D",""

In this paper, a lightweight blockchain called LBlockchainE is designed for edge IoT-enabled MTS to guarantee the security of sensor data stored in an edge computing environment. To save the resources of edge servers on ship, a data placement strategy is proposed. To encourage edge servers to positively contribute to storing data generated by sensor devices, storage resource consumption is employed as an influencing parameter, and servers with abundant resources are selected for priority storage. The data placement strategy also takes care of the access delay between servers and selects the nodes with the least access and storage costs as the priority storage choice. LBlockchainE applies the low-energy-consumption characteristics of Proof of Stake to determine the ownership of bookkeeping rights through a small number of competitive calculations and the resources of the node. Experimental results indicate that compared with Ethereum, the consensus mechanism of LBlockchainE consumes less energy and occupies less storage space. On average, the new system uses 1.6% less time and consumes 78% less battery power compared with traditional blockchain systems. In comparison to the random storage, the best storage, and the optimal data storage strategies, the proposed strategy maintains the same message costs.","https://www.proquest.com/docview/2774333773?accountid=44943&bdid=84593&_bd=myZuTnwFGgzkWp1sUb8S0U9DLTg%3D","https://doi.org/10.1109/TITS.2022.3157447"

To tackle this problem, we establish a nearshore network by collaboratively using on-shore terrestrial base stations (TBSs) and tethered unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). These TBSs and UAVs form virtual clusters in a user-centric manner. Within each virtual cluster, non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) is adopted for agilely including various maritime IoT devices, which are sparsely distributed over the vast ocean. The nearshore network also shares the spectrum with marine satellites. In such a NOMA-based hybrid satellite-UAV-terrestrial network, interference among different network segments, different clusters, and different users occurs. We thereby formulate a joint power allocation problem to maximize the sum rate of the network. Different from existing studies, we use large-scale channel state information (CSI) only for optimization to reduce system overhead. The large-scale CSI is obtained by using the position information of maritime IoT devices. The problem is non-convex with intractable non-linear constraints. We tackle these difficulties by adopting max-min optimization, the auxiliary function method, and the successive convex approximation technique. An iterative power allocation algorithm is accordingly proposed, which is shown to be effective for coverage enhancement by simulations. This shows the potential of NOMA-based hybrid satellite-UAV-terrestrial networks for maritime on-demand coverage.","https://www.proquest.com/docview/2761375555?accountid=44943&bdid=84593&_bd=cNyRgDm1sIBRNsg3xAKV51ARnQs%3D","https://doi.org/10.1109/TWC.2022.3191719"

More recent studies noted that behavioral control, spiritual intelligence, and intentions have a significant effect on behavior in marketing through e-commerce. In this study, a model developed by Darsono (2018) was further refined based on the results of the model trials carried out using data collected in Malang City, Indonesia. The objectives of this study are: (1) to determine the strategic policies of small and medium businesses in e-commerce marketing by using the Exponential Comparison Method (ECM), and (2) to analyze policy profiling for several types of e-commerce marketing by using correspondence analysis. The Exponential Comparison Method (ECM) is a data analysis techniques based on a decision support system that describes a complex multi-factor problem into a hierarchy where each level of the hierarchy is composed by several specific elements. By using the hierarchy, a complex and unstructured problem is broken down into groups which are then organized into a hierarchical form. Based on the results of ECM analysis, this study recommends the strategic policies of SMEs in the selection of e-commerce marketing related to attitudes towards e-commerce marketing, subjective norms, behavioral control, spiritual intelligence, and the intention to buy and sell online in the market with each attribute. The results of the correspondence analysis further explain the existence of special characteristics in each choice. In particular, (1) online buying and selling in the marketplace has been ranked as the first option based on two considerations, i.e., how to receive orders and shipping methods; (2) internet banking and SMS banking was ranked second based on place to sell products and payment methods; (3) cable TV and internet provider was chosen as the last option based on customer sevice; and finally (4) product considerations are noted in all options.","https://www.proquest.com/docview/2468435320?accountid=44943&bdid=84593&_bd=9SHRv1busDWMgnqlrcWluQWCnBA%3D","https://doi.org/10.9770/jesi.2019.7.2(30)"

However, there is little relevant research in the maritime industry, even though human errors significantly contribute to shipping accidents. It becomes even more worrisome given that seafarers are changing their roles onboard ships due to the growth of automation techniques in the sector. This research pioneers a conceptual framework for assessing seafarer psychological factors using neurophysiological analysis. It quantitatively enables the psychological factor assessment and hence can be used to test, verify, and train seafarers' behaviours for ship safety at sea and along coasts. A case study on ship collision avoidance in coastal waters demonstrates its feasibility using ship bridge simulation. An experimental framework incorporating neurophysiological data can be utilised to effectively evaluate the contribution of psychological factors to human behaviours and operational risks. Hence, it opens a new paradigm for human reliability analysis in a maritime setting. This framework provides insights for reforming and evaluating operators’ behaviours on traditionally crewed ships and in remote-controlled centres within the context of autonomous ships. As a result, it will significantly improve maritime safety and prevention of catastrophic accidents that endanger oceans and coasts.","https://www.proquest.com/docview/2834206229?accountid=44943&bdid=84593&_bd=ufS2aPLnkDhzR2xdejKS4q0Lv40%3D","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ocecoaman.2023.106515"

Analysis of the GPCC precipitation shows a dipolar structure of wet southwest versus dry central and northeast in precipitation anomalies associated with El Niño over Borneo Island during the austral summer [December–February (DJF)]. By using the 0.25° and 3-hourly CMORPH precipitation, it is found that rainfall over Borneo is strongly affected by the diurnal cycle of land–sea breezes. The spatial distribution of rainfall over Borneo depends on the direction of monsoonal winds. Weather typing analysis indicates that the dipolar structure of rainfall anomalies associated with ENSO is caused by the variability in the frequency of occurrence of different weather types. Rainfall is enhanced in the coastal region where sea breezes head against off-shore synoptic-scale low-level winds (i.e., in the lee side or wake area of the island), which is referred to here as the “wake effect.” In DJF of El Niño years, the northwesterly austral summer monsoon in southern Borneo is weaker than normal over the Maritime Continent and easterly winds are more frequent than normal over Borneo, acting to enhance rainfall over the southwest coast of the island. This coastal rainfall generation mechanism in different weather types explains the dipole pattern of a wet southwest versus dry northeast in the rainfall anomalies over Borneo Island in the El Niño years.","https://www.proquest.com/docview/2813974142?accountid=44943&bdid=84593&_bd=LGwdUTpZMuxtD8GvrKRD8wzfjmY%3D","https://doi.org/10.1175/JCLI-D-12-00178.1"

The proximity-based IoT service is a type of service that becomes available once an IoT object comes near other objects. This type of service typically involves proximity machine-type communication (MTC) that allows direct communication between objects in a spatiotemporal context on an ad-hoc basis. The IoT world has witnessed increasing cases of such applications in recent years, but proximity MTC has not received sufficient attention in the IoT community. As such, this paper presents the unique characteristics and requirements of proximity MTC, focusing on differentiating proximity MTC from infrastructure-based wide-area MTC and service-centric networking from host-centric networking. Specifically, the paper utilizes an emerging application in maritime IoT, maritime autonomous surface shipping (MASS), as an example and offers an insightful and rigorous examination of the legacy maritime communications technology, pointing out the pitfalls to avoid in the development and standardization of proximity MTC in light of the recent spectrum assignment by ITU.

However, all seem to point towards systems that will be more complex due to issues such as the tighter integration with software and the interactions with humans-in-the-loop. These ships will likely be completely different compared to conventional ones, which puts into question the usefulness of our current understanding of risk and how it is managed for ensuring safe operation. By a critical review of the literature, this paper highlights the need for advanced methods that will combine machine learning and simulation for dynamically assessing risk in a life cycle context and effectively transferring acquired operational knowledge back to the design phase. The main objective of this paper is to describe a novel life cycle risk framework for developing algorithms inspired by the biological immune system, which provides lifetime protection from harmful pathogens. This framework can be used to construct machine learning algorithms for dynamic risk monitoring and adaptive risk control that address different types of risk, while enabling faster future response to previously unencountered risks and operational feedback to design through learning. We demonstrate the feasibility of our approach in a specific maritime context with a case study on collision risk identification. Considering the lack of experience for autonomous ships, the benefit of our immune-inspired approach is that it departs from the classic risk scenario concept and that it does not rely on safety performance data for identifying risk factors and training the algorithms. We suggest this framework is particularly suitable for autonomous ships with high levels of autonomy, although applicable to conventional ships as well, as it can contribute to empowering them with risk awareness and the capability to deal with any risk environment.","https://www.proquest.com/docview/2793657685?accountid=44943&bdid=84593&_bd=vU9vkZuGHfkoUYYE2W4Rp4Lntuo%3D","https://doi.org/10.1177/1748006X221087501"

Traditional approaches to inventory planning based largely on rules of thumb rather than formal data analysis -lead to out-of-stock situations and supply inefficiencies. The complexities and uncertainties represented by today's constantly evolving global supply chains demand a dynamic new approach, and that's called inventory optimization. In a VMI partnership, the supplier, usually the manufacturer but sometimes a reseller or distributor, makes the main inventory replenishment decisions for the consuming organization. This means that the vendor monitors the buyer's inventory levels (physically or via electronic messaging) and makes periodic resupply decisions regarding order quantities, shipping,andtiming.","https://www.proquest.com/docview/1034101281?accountid=44943&bdid=84593&_bd=AzV%2Ft7zDNotfFEgp4n7kyyE8BpY%3D",""

Promoting the export of craft products, which are valued products, is critical for international business as the sales growth increases worldwide. Moreover, the export of craft products has increased international trade and maximized economic value in the highly competitive global market. Therefore, businesses need to be promoted to increase their competitiveness. This study explores the impact of export promotion programs on export competitiveness and the performance of craft products. A self-administered questionnaire was used to correct the data. There were 400 respondents completing the questionnaires, who were working in craft product export companies using marine transport. The data analysis is conducted by using Structure Equation Modelling (SEM). The findings show that the export promotion program has a significant positive relationship with export competitiveness. A positive relationship between export competitiveness and export performance is also found. The results indicate that export competitiveness fully mediates the relationship between export promotion programs and export performance. The findings from this study contribute to craft product export businesses and provide a practical exporting approach. Marine transport is one of the critical international entry modes many companies use to expand businesses. It should be noted that shipping cost savings are related to export efficiency.","https://www.proquest.com/docview/2694012711?accountid=44943&bdid=84593&_bd=%2BsJ2%2BD%2B%2Fpia%2BOhywCLME7Qw9dv4%3D","https://doi.org/10.3390/jmse10070892"

We propose that the acceleration of Arctic NWS is primarily driven by reduced stability in the lower troposphere due to increased upward heat fluxes and decreased surface roughness owing to the losses of Arctic glaciers and sea ice in a warming climate. In addition, the coupled climate models project a robust increase in the Arctic NWS under various warming scenarios during the 21st century, especially in the vicinity of the Kara Sea and the Beaufort Sea.","https://www.proquest.com/docview/3045198111?accountid=44943&bdid=84593&_bd=cNURzzo42H5Y6kkhDtgBfa%2Bt2q8%3D","https://doi.org/10.1029/2024GL109385"

Predicting and measuring these risks has a high complexity due to their infrequent occurrence, multitude of causes, and large study areas. As a result, maritime risk models are generally limited in scale to small regions, generalized across diverse environments, or rely on the use of expert judgement. Therefore, such an approach has limited scalability and may incorrectly characterize the risk. Within this article a novel method for undertaking spatial modeling of maritime risk is proposed through machine learning. This enables navigational safety to be characterized while leveraging the significant volumes of relevant data available. The method comprises two key components: aggregation of historical accident data, vessel traffic, and other exploratory features into a spatial grid; and the implementation of several classification algorithms that predicts annual accident occurrence for various vessel types. This approach is applied to characterize the risk of collisions and groundings in the United Kingdom. The results vary between hazard types and vessel types but show remarkable capability at characterizing maritime risk, with accuracies and area under curve scores in excess of 90% in most implementations. Furthermore, the ensemble tree‐based algorithms of XGBoost and Random Forest consistently outperformed other machine learning algorithms that were tested. The resultant potential risk maps provide decisionmakers with actionable intelligence in order to target risk mitigation measures in regions with the greatest requirement.","https://www.proquest.com/docview/2736079853?accountid=44943&bdid=84593&_bd=IRdR%2BNRN%2Fxn4jdNpv2vPFNabQ%2BU%3D","https://doi.org/10.1111/risa.13866"

How might the military, law enforcement, and intelligence communities respond to maritime threats if these new technologies eliminate anonymity at sea? The emerging evidence presented on maritime activities is intertwined with national security (e.g., territorial and resource claims, sanctions violations, and terrorist attacks), legal and illicit businesses (e.g., illegal fishing, trafficking, and piracy), and other concerns (e.g., shipping and transit, chokepoints, and environmental damage).

Therefore, we explore the shipping firms' blockchain technology investment strategies under a competitive model and investigate the shipping firms' equilibrium outcomes, consumer surplus and social welfare under different scenarios. We demonstrate that blockchain technology investment cost and logistics service transparency combine to influence shipping firms' market demand, optimal market price and profit. Moreover, we find that shipping firms do not (will) invest in blockchain technology when the investment cost of blockchain technology is high (low). When investment costs and logistics service transparency match each other, the shipping firms reach an asymmetric equilibrium, i.e., only one shipping firm adopts blockchain technology. It is noteworthy that when neither shipping firms invest in blockchain technology, the shipping firms may slip into a prisoner's dilemma. We also show that the competition level and the transparency of logistics services increase the possibility of a prisoner's dilemma. Finally, our results show that shipping firms' blockchain technology investments are conducive to increasing social welfare and consumer surplus, but market competition and logistics service transparency constrain the increase in social welfare and consumer surplus.","https://www.proquest.com/docview/2887995997?accountid=44943&bdid=84593&_bd=xx0qJD3X08u2E%2FP5QX%2BecUOaxwc%3D","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ocecoaman.2023.106696"

Nowadays, the maritime transport accounts for a large share of transport demand, and the importance of sustainable ship design is increasingly growing, not only for ethical and legislative but also for competitive reasons. The design of a sustainable ship considering all those aspects is a complex process in this regard. One way to manage the complexity is to identify and avoid the functional couplings at the early stage of the design process. This paper presents the conceptual design of a merchant ship's conventional propulsion system with a view to the Axiomatic Design framework and known sustainable engineering principles. We also explore the Bayesian machine learning interface to propose a data-driven method for calculating the probability of achieving specific sustainability-related functional requirements. Data-driven Bayesian reasoning can also be used to select the best design parameter among the proposed alternatives as well as to identify hidden design couplings that have not identified by the designers in the conceptual design stage.","https://www.proquest.com/docview/2572261007?accountid=44943&bdid=84593&_bd=0CBqN3HV5PyjGKGipsfeYnrf%2FaU%3D","https://doi.org/10.1088/1757-899X/1174/1/012003"

Motivated by market practices, this study intends to discuss the potential application value of blockchain platforms in shipping logistics, considering the perceived utility of consumers. For this purpose, to investigate the shipping logistics supply chain (SLSC) of a shipping company (SC) and a freight forwarding company (FFC), in which FFC decides whether to introduce a blockchain platform and its introduction channel. Specifically, three channel models are considered: Model T (i.e., traditional logistics supply chain channel), Model B (i.e., FFCs applied a blockchain platform via a self-built platform channel), and Model J (i.e., FFCs applied a blockchain platform via joining a third-party platform channel). Meanwhile, the Nash and Stackelberg game are used to characterize the companies’ equilibrium outcomes under different power structures. By comparing these three modes, some interesting results are found: consumer perception of the level of service and privacy protection and consumer sensitivity to price has critical effects on the value of blockchain platforms. Results also show that the blockchain platform does not always motivate the members of the SLSC to become better. Whether the power structure is symmetrical or asymmetrical, FFC adopts Model B instead of Model J, in which the blockchain platform can help FFC increase profits, and the value of blockchain is significant. Moreover, the FFC can obtain at least approximately 78% more benefit when the power structure is symmetrical than asymmetrical. However, the value of blockchain platforms to SC is not necessarily significant. The value of the blockchain platform for SC is significant only in Model B with the power structure asymmetric. Therefore, the value of the blockchain platform in Model B with the power structure asymmetrical for both FFCs and SCs is significant, achieving a win-win situation. Also, an extensive numerical analysis showing the optimal channel strategy in the three models generated additional management insights.","https://www.proquest.com/docview/2844099173?accountid=44943&bdid=84593&_bd=ntnijj82imayrLsLaNMfIWTYMw0%3D","https://doi.org/10.1051/ro/2023082"

Secondary data analysis from a sample of six companies supports the identification and discussion of the real advantages, disadvantages and barriers felt by companies in a fashion supply chain when RFID technology is introduced. Findings - The logistics activities in the fashion supply chain where RFID technology is most widely deployed are: shipping operations, tracking of raw materials, semi-finished components and finished garments, collecting finished goods, handling processes, tracking containers, tracking products from factory to store, receiving operations, monitoring, and sorting of merchandise. In most cases, the tagging operation is performed at some stage in the production process and tag reading occurs at distribution centres or at stores. The main barrier identified to the deployment of RFID is the problem of interoperability. The costs associated with the technology are the main disadvantage pointed out by the companies. Practical implications - A conceptual framework is proposed exploring the RFID advantages and disadvantages across the fashion supply chain, the main barriers to its introduction and the fashion supply chain logistics activities in which RFID could be found. This represents an important contribution to companies in this industry to become more aware of RFID. Also, new companies which are thinking of introducing this technology could overcome its barriers easily, improving its advantages and minimizing its disadvantages. Originality/value - This paper explores the deployment of RFID in the fashion supply chain from the perspective of technology users.","https://www.proquest.com/docview/918505546?accountid=44943&bdid=84593&_bd=mlMnzmzv2j2H1OwxgmH%2BptylhCk%3D","https://doi.org/10.1108/09590551211201874"

The equipment used includes cameras, a GPS, measuring tools (waterpass, callipers, measuring threads, pendulum) and a computer. The results were interpreted descriptively. The results show that the Sungkur fishing boat with the towed method has good static and dynamic stabilities and has met the International Maritime Organization (IMO) minimum standard values. It also presents a good return energy, returning safely to its original position after destabilisation. The optimal redesign of the Sungkur fishing boat can be achieved by making several prototype changes toward improving the coefficients of fineness of the tested boats.","https://www.proquest.com/docview/2350114273?accountid=44943&bdid=84593&_bd=WClsXx%2F0C192mXHT5De4Z1DFO74%3D",""

Our estimates are provided in the form of a dataset of reduction factors varying per country and day that will allow the modelling and identification of the associated impacts upon air quality. The country- and daily-resolved reduction factors are provided for each of the following source categories: energy industry (power plants), manufacturing industry, road traffic and aviation (landing and take-off cycle). We computed the reduction factors based on open-access and near-real-time measured activity data from a wide range of information sources. We also trained a machine learning model with meteorological data to derive weather-normalized electricity consumption reductions. The time period covered is from 21 February, when the first European localized lockdown was implemented in the region of Lombardy (Italy), until 26 April 2020. This period includes 5 weeks (23 March until 26 April) with the most severe and relatively unchanged restrictions upon mobility and socio-economic activities across Europe. The computed reduction factors were combined with the Copernicus Atmosphere Monitoring Service's European emission inventory using adjusted temporal emission profiles in order to derive time-resolved emission reductions per country and pollutant sector. During the most severe lockdown period, we estimate the average emission reductions to be -33% for NOx, -8% for non-methane volatile organic compounds (NMVOCs), -7% for SOxand -7% for PM2.5at the EU-30 level (EU-28 plus Norway and Switzerland). For all pollutants more than 85 % of the total reduction is attributable to road transport, except SOx. The reductions reached -50% (NOx), -14% (NMVOCs), -12% (SOx) and -15% (PM2.5) in countries where the lockdown restrictions were more severe such as Italy, France or Spain. To show the potential for air quality modelling, we simulated and evaluated NO2concentration decreases in rural and urban background regions across Europe (Italy, Spain, France, Germany, United-Kingdom and Sweden). We found the lockdown measures to be responsible for NO2reductions of up to -58% at urban background locations (Madrid, Spain) and -44% at rural background areas (France), with an average contribution of the traffic sector to total reductions of 86 % and 93 %, respectively. A clear improvement of the modelled results was found when considering the emission reduction factors, especially in Madrid, Paris and London where the bias is reduced by more than 90 %. Future updates will include the extension of the COVID-19 lockdown period covered, the addition of other pollutant sectors potentially affected by the restrictions (commercial and residential combustion and shipping) and the evaluation of other air quality pollutants such as O3and PM2.5.

Analysis of the GPCC precipitation shows a dipolar structure of wet southwest versus dry central and northeast in precipitation anomalies associated with El Niño over Borneo Island during the austral summer [December-February (DJF)]. By using the 0.258 and 3-hourly CMORPH precipitation, it is found that rainfall over Borneo is strongly affected by the diurnal cycle of land-sea breezes. The spatial distribution of rainfall over Borneo depends on the direction of monsoonal winds. Weather typing analysis indicates that the dipolar structure of rainfall anomalies associated with ENSO is caused by the variability in the frequency of occurrence of different weather types. Rainfall is enhanced in the coastal region where sea breezes head against off-shore synoptic-scale low-level winds (i.e., in the lee side or wake area of the island), which is referred to here as the ''wake effect.'' In DJF of El Niño years, the northwesterly austral summer monsoon in southern Borneo is weaker than normal over the Maritime Continent and easterly winds are more frequent than normal over Borneo, acting to enhance rainfall over the southwest coast of the island. This coastal rainfall generation mechanism in different weather types explains the dipole pattern of a wet southwest versus dry northeast in the rainfall anomalies over Borneo Island in the El Niño years.

Recently, the number of ore ships waiting to berth has increased significantly at the major iron ore unloading ports along the coast of China. Factors, such as weather influences and concentrated arrivals, make the problem of port ore ships under pressure reappear. This article describes the overall situation of China’s iron and steel market and coastal iron ore transportation and analyzes the characteristics of iron ore import transportation in various regions. The construction layout, stockpiling situation conditions and the capacity adaptability of China’s iron ore terminals are systematically studied. And it proposes that the specialized ore unloading terminals generally need to meet the demand of foreign trade imports. However, the capacity of the Bohai Rim, the Yangtze River Delta and the regions are-as along the coast is still tight, and the local port pressure is still prominent. In the future, further research and the optimization of China’s iron ore unloading terminal system should be done. Through AIS dynamic data monitoring, port and shipping big data mining and analysis, and the other new technical means, the adaptability of iron ore unloading capacity at terminal is refined research, the peak arrival of ships and other situations are properly handled, and China’s iron ore foreign trade Import transportation is protected stablly and safely.","https://www.proquest.com/docview/2513009539?accountid=44943&bdid=84593&_bd=vttnd%2BGo6kiikvKdOOdQhiwclz0%3D","https://doi.org/10.1088/1755-1315/671/1/012008"

However, blockchain application in the maritime supply chain remains notably absent, leaving this critical topic almost unexplored. Thus, we first conduct a comprehensive literature review and an industrial investigation to clarify the current status, problems, and challenges of the blockchain-based maritime supply chain system (BMSCS). We construct a new operation management mode of the maritime supply chain and propose an integrated BMSCS suitable for global economic development. Finally, based on comparison of the current research results, reasonable suggestions for the future operation and development of the BMSCS are put forward to enhance the coordination among members, accelerate the application of blockchain in the maritime industry, and gradually realise the intelligent operation of the maritime supply chain.","https://www.proquest.com/docview/2812262335?accountid=44943&bdid=84593&_bd=KlPSHErq%2BE4ib0ThvuWHZA2tw7Y%3D","https://doi.org/10.1080/00207543.2021.1930239"

In addition to supporting crew competence, another factor which is no less important is the discipline of the crew itself. But in reality many crew members do not meet the standards and qualifications given by the company, so they do not provide maximum performance, as a result the achievement of company performance is very low. Solving problems related to this matter is the holding of job training in the field of Human Resources Management (HRM) with the aim of forming competent crew so that in the future it is expected to provide optimal company performance. Problems regarding discipline crew are the low awareness of the ship's crew of the importance of discipline while working on the ship. The right way to overcome this is to conduct training to increase crew awareness and to conduct periodic evaluations of the implementation of activities that assess the discipline of the crew. The purpose of this study was to determine how much influence the competence and discipline on the performance of P T.

In many jurisdictions, management strategies are being developed in an attempt to reduce the environmental and economic harm these species may cause in the receiving ecosystem. Scientific studies to improve understanding of the mechanisms behind invasive species population growth and spread are key components in the development of control methods. The work presented herein is motivated by the case of the European green crab (Carcinus maenas L.), a remarkably adaptable organism that has invaded marine coastal waters around the globe. Two genotypes of European green crab have independently invaded the Atlantic coast of Canada. One genotype invaded the mid-Atlantic coast of the USA by 1817, subsequently spreading northward through New England and reaching Atlantic Canada by 1951. A second genotype, originating from the northern limit of the green crabs European range, invaded the Atlantic coast of Nova Scotia in the 1980s and is spreading southward from the Canadian Maritime provinces. We developed an integrodifference equation model for green crab population growth, competition and spread, and demonstrate that it yields appropriate spread rates for the two genotypes, based on historical data. Analysis of our model indicates that while harvesting efforts have the benefit of reducing green crab density and slowing the spread rate of the two genotypes, elimination of the green crab is virtually impossible with harvesting alone. Accordingly, a green crab fishery would be sustainable. We also demonstrate that with harvesting and restocking, the competitive imbalance between the Northern and Southern green crab genotypes can be reversed. That is, a competitively inferior species can be used to control a competitively superior one.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]","https://www.proquest.com/docview/1601224000?accountid=44943&bdid=84593&_bd=8I6LWrGRtxE3MZV3rr72jCayt8A%3D","https://doi.org/10.1007/s12080-014-0226-8"

A machine vision-based ship collision warning method is proposed for high monitoring system cost and limited information acquisition in safety design of autonomous ship navigation. The method combines machine learning with image algorithms. Firstly, the backbone of YOLOv7 detector is replaced by EfficientFormerV2 network to achieve model lightweight while ensuring detection accuracy. Public datasets SeaShips, Flow and self-made ship pictures are combined, and the network is trained on this dataset. StrongSORT is used for target tracking. Secondly, a data fusion algorithm is introduced to determine the target point at the bow-bottom of the ship based on the time-varying attitude of the camera and the time-series features of the bounding boxes. Ship navigation trajectory estimation is performed using image algorithms. Finally, a collision evaluation model is established to calculate the collision risk index. Experimental results demonstrate that the improved YOLOv7 network maintains similar mAP.5 and Recall compared to the original model, while reducing the parameters by 31.2 % and GFLOPs by 58.4 %. The accuracy of target ship trajectory estimation is high, with MAE values below 1.5 % and RMSE values below 2 % in experiments. In ship collision warning experiments, the proposed method accurately identifies navigating vessels, estimates the trajectories, and provides timely warnings for imminent collision accidents. Compared to traditional ship collision warning methods, this paper offers a more intelligent and lightweight solution.","https://www.proquest.com/docview/2922949350?accountid=44943&bdid=84593&_bd=uCEAt9dLHnbUTH1m4OrKX6sAXe0%3D","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.heliyon.2024.e25105"

We considered metrics traditionally used to estimate emissions, such as energy statistics or traffic counts, as well as information derived from new mobility indicators and machine learning techniques. The resulting dataset covers a total of nine emission sectors, including road transport, the energy industry, the manufacturing industry, residential and commercial combustion, aviation, shipping, off-road transport, use of solvents, and fugitive emissions from transportation and distribution of fossil fuels. The dataset was produced to be combined with the Copernicus CAMS-REG_v5.1 2020 business-as-usual (BAU) inventory, which provides high-resolution (0.1∘×0.05∘) emission estimates for 2020 omitting the impact of the COVID-19 restrictions. The combination of both datasets allows quantifying spatially and temporally resolved reductions in primary emissions from both criteria pollutants (NOx, SO2, non-methane volatile organic compounds – NMVOCs, NH3, CO, PM10and PM2.5) and greenhouse gases (CO2fossil fuel, CO2biofuel andCH4), as well as assessing the contribution of each emission sector and European country to the overall emission changes. Estimated overall emission changes in 2020 relative to BAU emissions were as follows: -10.5 % forNOx(-602 kt), -7.8 % (-260.2 Mt) for CO2from fossil fuels,-4.7 % (-808.5 kt) for CO, -4.6 % (-80 kt) for SO2, -3.3 % (-19.1 Mt) for CO2from biofuels, -3.0 % (-56.3 kt) for PM10, -2.5 % (-173.3 kt) for NMVOCs, -2.1 % (-24.3 kt) for PM2.5, -0.9 % (-156.1 kt) for CH4and -0.2 % (-8.6 kt) for NH3. The most pronounced drop in emissions occurred in April (up to -32.8 % on average forNOx) when mobility restrictions were at their maxima. The emission reductions during the second epidemic wave between October and December were 3 to 4 times lower than those occurred during the spring lockdown, as mobility restrictions were generally softer (e.g. curfews, limited social gatherings). Italy, France, Spain, the United Kingdom and Germany were, together, the largest contributors to the total EU27 + UK (27 member states of the European Union and the UK) absolute emission decreases. At the sectoral level, the largest emission declines were found for aviation (-51 % to -56 %), followed by road transport (-15.5 % to -18.8 %), the latter being the main driver of the estimated reductions for the majority of pollutants. The collection of COVID-19 emission adjustment factors (10.24380/k966-3957, Guevara et al., 2022) and the CAMS-REG_v5.1 2020 BAU gridded inventory (10.24380/eptm-kn40, Kuenen et al., 2022b) have been produced in support of air quality modelling studies.","https://www.proquest.com/docview/2672185472?accountid=44943&bdid=84593&_bd=DJY2Nh%2Ftu5psPZKQFNdbcuupTI8%3D","https://doi.org/10.5194/essd-14-2521-2022"
"A Meta-Analysis to Understand the Variability in Reported Source Levels of Noise Radiated by Ships From Opportunistic Studies","","Chion, Clément; Lagrois, Dominic; Dupras, Jérôme","Frontiers in Marine Science","Scholarly Journals","","","","2019-11-26","Nov 26, 2019","n/a","","","2296-7745","","","ENG","Commercial shipping is identified as a major source of anthropogenic underwater noise in several ecologically sensitive areas. Any development project likely to increase marine traﬃc can thus be required to assess environmental impacts of underwater noise. Therefore, project holders are increasingly engaging in underwater noise modeling relying on ships’ underwater noise source levels published in the literature. However, a lack of apparent consensus emerges from the scientific literature as discrepancies up to 30 dB re 1µPa are reported for ships’ broadband source levels belonging to the same vessel class and operating under similar conditions. We present a statistical meta-analysis of individual ships’ broadband source levels available in the literature so far to identify which factors likely explain these discrepancies. We collated ships’ source levels from the published literature to construct our dataset. A Generalized Linear Mixed Model was applied to the dataset to statistically assess the contribution of intrinsic (related to ships’ static and dynamic attributes) and extrinsic factors (related to both the protocol for hydroacoustic data acquisition and the noise data reduction procedure) to the reported broadband source levels. Amongst intrinsic factors, ships’ speed-over-ground (15.13 × log 10 (v); p-value < 0.001), ships’ width (12.07 × log 10 (b); p-value < 0.001), and ships’ class (-6.07 − 2.09 dB re 1µPa; p-value ∈ [< 0.001 − 0.031]) have shown the strongest correlations with broadband source levels. The hydrophone-to-source closest point of approach (-4.81 dB re 1µPa nm −1 ; p-value < 0.001) and the computation of monopole source levels (22.33 dB re 1µPa; p-value = 0.003) instead of range-independent dipole measurements contribute the most to explain the reported ships’ broadband source levels variability amongst extrinsic factors. Our meta-analysis conﬁrms a consensus that speed regulation can effectively reduce instantaneous ships’ source levels. The abuse of a dipole approach for data analysis and spreading laws for transmission loss leads to a generalized under-estimation of the ships’ source levels retrieved from the literature. This could be addressed by a wider adoption of standardized methods of hydrophone-based sound recordings and of data processing to homogenize results and facilitate interpretation for environmental impact assessment.","https://www.proquest.com/docview/2318357845?accountid=44943&bdid=84593&_bd=oCm6l3LjFr3ZUh75EQk41UqoDAg%3D","https://doi.org/10.3389/fmars.2019.00714"
"The impact of thawing duration on leptin and adiponectin levels in frozen human milk samples","","Harries, Victoria; Corley, Margaret; Bribiescas, Richard G","American Journal of Human Biology","Scholarly Journals","","36","1","2024-01-01","Jan 2024","","","","10420533","","","ENG","BackgroundMeasurements of hormone concentrations in human milk from understudied populations across the world is of growing scientific interest. Due to limited access to suitable laboratory facilities at many research sites, human milk samples are often shipped frozen to distant laboratories for analysis. Shipping and handling exposes samples to the risk of thawing and degradation as the results of delays, mishandling, or other unforeseen circumstances. Similar degradation risk factors are well known in serum samples. However, the vulnerability of hormone degradation in human milk to thawing during transportation is largely unexplored. Leptin and adiponectin are of particular importance due to their roles in feeding behavior and metabolism in infants, hence our focus on these two hormones. In addition, leptin and adiponectin have been shown to be vulnerable to pasteurization temperature degradation in human milk samples.AimsWe tested the degradation of human milk metabolic hormones – leptin and adiponectin – in a controlled environment in response to a variety of freeze/thaw conditions that are reflective of potential temperature fluctuations during transportation.Materials & MethodsHuman milk samples were experimentally subjected to thaw durations ranging from 4 to 16 h and assayed for hormonal levels to observe changes from baseline. Samples were also subjected to two additional experimental conditions, re‐freezing after an extended period outside freezers or remaining thawed with additional ice packs, to investigate the impact of common transportation conditions.ResultsWe found the assayed levels of leptin were not significantly impacted by an extended thaw cycle of 16 h. However, leptin levels were impacted by the extended period of 40 h outside of the freezer. Adiponectin showed a decrease in concentration percentage after the initial 16‐h thaw period, but the increased degradation between 0–16 h and 16–40 h was not as severe as that seen in the leptin samples.Discussion & ConclusionThe results of this experiment can be used to inform hormone measurement consistency given different thawing lengths or freezing conditions during transportation. Additionally, this research informs decisions regarding transportation, storage/handling, and data analysis in human milk research.","https://www.proquest.com/docview/2913418732?accountid=44943&bdid=84593&_bd=Jr5imzz9Xso400tULj0AoI7%2B1xA%3D","https://doi.org/10.1002/ajhb.23971"

The DMC established a cloud-based architecture using Amazon Web Services to track, store, and share data according to National Institutes of Health standards. The DMC tracks biological samples during collection, shipping, and processing while capturing sample metadata and associated clinical data. Multi-omic datasets are stored in access-controlled Amazon Simple Storage Service (S3) for data security and file version control. All data undergo quality control processes at the generating site followed by DMC validation for quality assurance. The DMC maintains a controlled computing environment for data analysis and integration. Upon publication, the DMC deposits finalized datasets to public repositories. The DMC architecture provides resources and scientific expertise to accelerate translational discovery. Robust operations allow rapid sharing of results across the project team.

The purpose of this paper is to explore vocational education and training (VET) institution leaders’ character features. The research question was twofold: What are the features of the character of the pedagogical leaders of three Latvian VET institutions according to students, teachers and institution board members? What are the differences between respondents’ groups regarding their perceptions of leaders’ virtues?Design/methodology/approachSix members of the institution board, five teachers and six students participated in structured qualitative interviews collected in 2013 in three high-quality VET institutions from different fields (tourism, sports and maritime education). Secondary analysis of latent content was used to explore respondents’ perceptions of leaders’ virtues, using software AQUAD 7 for qualitative data analysis.FindingsThe results revealed significant differences between students’ and staff (teachers’ and institution board members’) perceptions: the staff members appreciated particularly leaders’ performance virtues (“teamwork orientation”) and intellectual virtues (“critical thinking”), whereas, for students, heads’ moral virtues were more relevant, especially “magnanimity”. Respondents also showed concern about VET institution leaders’ civic virtues (“neighborliness,” “community awareness,” and “communicability”).Practical implicationsThe results suggest that different perspectives, and in particular students’ voices, should be integrated in VET leaders’ assessment process and that their continuing professional development should also address their intellectual, moral and civic virtues.Originality/valueThis study represents an innovative methodological trial for investigating educational institution heads’ leadership from the lens of virtue ethics.","https://www.proquest.com/docview/2533073375?accountid=44943&bdid=84593&_bd=OvTw%2FQ%2BkXNDjsbAiPYVlcArEbLQ%3D","https://doi.org/10.1108/QAE-11-2018-0124"
"The Earth radiation balance as driver of the global hydrological cycle","","Wild, Martin; Liepert, Beate","Environmental Research Letters","Scholarly Journals","","5","2","2010-06-01","Jun 2010","","","","17489326","","","ENG","Variations in the intensity of the global hydrological cycle can have far-reaching effects on living conditions on our planet. While climate change discussions often revolve around possible consequences of future temperature changes, the adaptation to changes in the hydrological cycle may pose a bigger challenge to societies and ecosystems. Floods and droughts are already today amongst the most damaging natural hazards, with floods being globally the most significant disaster type in terms of loss of human life (Jonkman 2005). From an economic perspective, changes in the hydrological cycle can impose great pressures and damages on a variety of industrial sectors, such as water management, urban planning, agricultural production and tourism. Despite their obvious environmental and societal importance, our understanding of the causes and magnitude of the variations of the hydrological cycle is still unsatisfactory (e.g., Ramanathan et al 2001, Ohmura and Wild 2002, Allen and Ingram 2002, Allan 2007, Wild et al 2008, Liepert and Previdi 2009).The link between radiation balance and hydrological cycleGlobally, precipitation can be approximated by surface evaporation, since the variability of the atmospheric moisture storage is negligible. This is the case because the fluxes are an order of magnitude larger than the atmospheric storage (423 x 1012 m3 year-1 versus 13 x 1012 m3 according to Baumgartner and Reichel (1975)), the latter being determined by temperature (Clausius–Clapeyron). Hence the residence time of evaporated water in the atmosphere is not more than a few days, before it condenses and falls back to Earth in the form of precipitation. Any change in the globally averaged surface evaporation therefore implies an equivalent change in precipitation, and thus in the intensity of the global hydrological cycle. The process of evaporation requires energy, which it obtains from the surface radiation balance (also known as surface net radiation), composed of the absorbed solar and net thermal radiative exchanges at the Earth's surface. Globally averaged, this surface radiation balance is positive, since radiative absorption, scattering and emission in the climate system act to generate an energy surplus at the surface and an energy deficit in the atmosphere (Liepert 2010).Evaporation, or more precisely its energy equivalent, the latent heat flux, is the main process that compensates for this imbalance between surface and atmosphere, since the latent heat dominates the convective energy flux over sensible heating. The radiative energy surplus at the surface is thus mainly consumed by evaporation and moist convection and subsequently released in the atmosphere through condensation. This implies that any alterations in the available radiative energy will induce changes in the water fluxes. Our focus in this editorial is therefore on the surface radiation balance as the principal driver of the global hydrological cycle.Note that this energetic view is in agreement with that of Richter and Xie (2008) who argue that the spatial and temporal behaviour of the process of evaporation is controlled by surface and atmospheric properties such as atmospheric stability, wind speed, moisture deficit and moisture availability.From radiation theory it is expected that with increasing radiative absorption due to abundance of anthropogenic greenhouse gases in the atmosphere and consequent warming, the emission of thermal energy from the atmosphere towards the surface is increasing (known as downward thermal radiation). This enhances the radiative energy surplus at the surface, and, where surface water is not limited, fuels evaporation besides warming the Earth's surface. The enhanced greenhouse effect therefore tends to accelerate the hydrological cycle, as also shown in many climate model simulations with increasing levels of greenhouse gases (e.g., IPCC 2007, but also see Yang et al 2003, Andrews et al 2009). We can assume that the increase in greenhouse gases since preindustrial times had already led to a substantial increase of downward thermal radiation during the 20th century, even though direct observational evidence is sparse and restricted to the latter part of the century (Philipona et al 2004, Wild et al 2008). Precipitation records averaged over global land surfaces indicate an overall, albeit not significant, increase in precipitation and intensification of the hydrological cycle over the 20th century (Trenberth et al 2007), in line with the aforementioned surface energy gain from the increased greenhouse gases and related downward thermal radiation. However, the observations show also that precipitation has not simply followed the increasing greenhouse gas forcing, but has undergone strong decadal variations, with extended periods of both increases and decreases. This is evident in figure 1(a), which shows global land precipitation over the 20th century as determined from the Global Historic Climate Network (GHCN; Peterson and Vose 1997, see also Trenberth et al 2007, figure 3.12). An increase in precipitation can be noted in the 1940s, followed by an overall decrease until the mid-1980s, and a renewed increase more recently.Figure 1. Observed terrestrial precipitation anomalies (a) and the longest observational surface solar radiation record measured in Stockholm (b) covering the period 1923–2000 (annual means). The 11-year running means are given in blue. Precipitation data from GHCN, radiation data from GEBA.However, not only greenhouse-gas-induced thermal radiation changes, but also solar radiation, as a result of changes in the atmospheric transmission, can alter the surface radiation balance and thus the amount of energy available to drive the hydrological cycle. Solar forcings may be even more efficient in modifying the intensity of the hydrological cycle than thermal forcings, as indicated by a higher hydrological sensitivity (e.g., Allen and Ingram 2002, Liepert et al 2004). The hydrological sensitivity, defined as change of precipitation per unit temperature change, is found to be 2–3 times larger under solar forcings than under thermal forcings (Liepert et 	al 2004, Andrews et al 2009). This is related to the fact that solar forcings apply at the surface directly because of the high solar transparency of the atmosphere compared to thermal radiation. Solar forcings thus effectively alter the surface radiation balance and the associated imbalance between the surface and atmospheric energy contents, which needs to be compensated for by convective fluxes and related evaporation/precipitation. Greenhouse-gas-induced thermal forcings, on the other hand, heat the atmosphere directly through radiative absorption and the surface indirectly through downward thermal radiation. Thermal forcings are therefore less effective in strengthening the imbalance between the surface and atmospheric energy contents. Hence the required changes in the compensational convective fluxes and associated evaporation/precipitation are smaller (equation (4) in Liepert and Previdi 2009). The different effects of solar and thermal forcings become particularly evident in the direct (fast) response of the hydrological cycle to them, while the subsequent longer-term response of the hydrological cycle, including all feedbacks induced by these forcings, is similar between the two forcing mechanisms (Andrews et al 2009, Lambert and Webb 2008). The direct effect of doubling of CO2 concentration reduces the precipitation increase in climate models by about 25% (Lambert and Webb 2008), while such compensational effects do not apply with solar forcings.Recent evidence suggests that the amount of solar radiation incident at the Earth's surface (hereafter referred to as downward solar radiation) has indeed not been stable over time but has undergone significant variations on decadal timescales. This evidence comes from the networks of surface radiation measurements taken around the globe which became operational on a widespread basis during the 1950s. Specifically, the measurements show a predominant decrease in downward solar radiation from the 1950s up to the 1980s (known as 'global dimming') and a partial recovery thereafter at many of the sites (known as 'brightening') (e.g., Gilgen et al 1998, Stanhill and Cohen 2001, Liepert 2002, Wild et al 2005, Wild 2009a). The consecutive downward and upward trends have at least to some extent been attributed to increasing and decreasing air pollution, respectively (Streets et al 2009), apart from the natural inter-decadal variability of cloudiness and volcanic eruptions. The longest observational records show in addition a tendency for an increase in downward solar radiation in the first part of the 20th century ('early brightening'). An illustrative example is given in figure 1(b), which depicts the longest continuous record of downward solar radiation measured in Stockholm. This series, starting in 1923, shows an increase in the 1930s and 1940s, an overall decrease from the 1950s up to the 1980s and a more recent recovery. This evolution is, surprisingly, at least qualitatively similar to the global land precipitation record shown in figure 1(a). Although a comparison of a radiation time series measured at a single station with a global land-averaged precipitation time series is by no means representative, it may illustrate the above point of a potential close link between decadal variations of surface radiation and precipitation.Attempts have been made to infer decadal changes in the surface radiation balance based on both modelling and observational approaches. Liepert et al (2004) analyzed equilibrium experiments with a climate model with greenhouse gas and aerosol concentrations representative for mid-1880s and mid-1980s conditions, respectively. They noted a decrease in absorbed solar radiation at the surface of 3.8 Wm-2 globally, mainly due to the aerosol direct and indirect effects, which are larger than the increased greenhouse effect of 1.9 Wm-2. This resulted in a reduction of net surface radiation of 1.9 Wm-2 globally, and a related spin down of the simulated hydrological cycle. Wild et al (2004), based on observational evidence, estimated that the decrease in downward solar radiation between the 1950s and 1980s may have overcompensated the increase in the greenhouse-gas-induced downward thermal radiation during the same period, thus implying a decrease in the surface radiation balance over this period. This fits well with the overall decrease in global terrestrial precipitation between the 1950s and 1980s seen in figure 1(a). This decrease is on the order of 30–40 mm, which corresponds to roughly 3 Wm-2 latent heat equivalent, and which would imply a similar decrease in surface net radiation. Assuming further a decreasing net surface thermal cooling of -1 Wm-2 over this period (Wild et al 2004), this would require an overall decline of about 4 Wm-2 in surface solar radiation to balance it, which is not unrealistic.Since the 1980s, however, there are indications that downward solar radiation overall has recovered and contributed to the increase in the radiative imbalance at the surface, which had increased already due to the increasing downward thermal radiation (Wild et al 2008, see also figure 1(b). This increase in the surface radiation balance, estimated at 2 Wm-2 decade-1 in Wild et al (2008), fits the observational evidence for a recent increase in terrestrial precipitation and associated intensification of the hydrological cycle (figure 1(a)).Improved knowledge of variations of the components of the surface radiation balance is therefore a key to our understanding of past, present and future variations in the intensity of the hydrological cycle.Surface radiation balance and the hydrological cycle in climate modelsA number of recent studies have pointed out that climate models driven with all known historical forcings simulate smaller changes in precipitation than observed over recent decades (Zhang et al 2007, Wentz et al 2007, Allan and Soden 2007, Liepert and Previdi 2009, Wild et al 2008, Wild 2009a), and may underestimate the increase in precipitation extremes with global warming (Allan and Soden 2008).For the present study, in figure 2 we compare precipitation changes during the 20th century over land surfaces as observed (blue lines, equivalent to figure 1(a)) and simulated by 18 individual coupled atmosphere-ocean models (CMIP3 models) used in the IPCC-AR4 report (in red). Shown are annual anomalies with respect to the 20th century means (dashed lines) as well as superimposed 11-year running means (solid lines) that highlight the decadal variations in both models and observations. None of the models captures the observed decadal variations during the 20th century. Particularly, none of the models qualitatively reproduces the sequence of increase in the 1930s/1940s, decrease from 1950s to the 1980s and renewed increase to 2000, and the correlations between observations and models are insignificant. Standard deviations of the 11-year running means, indicative of the amplitude of decadal variations in the 20th century annual precipitation, amount to 10.7 mm in the GHNC observations and 5.0 mm on average in the models (with a range from 2.6 mm to 10.6 mm). The closest standard deviation to the observations with 10.6 mm is found in the miroc_medres model simulation; however this simulation does not reproduce the main temporal characteristics of the observed time series either (figure 2). Thus, none of the models is capable of simulating the full extent and temporal evolution of decadal variations in 20th century terrestrial precipitation (see also Liepert and Previdi 2009).Here we argue that, among other possibilities, inadequacies in the simulation of surface radiation balance may contribute to the poor simulation of decadal variations in precipitation during the 20th century seen in figure 2. A closer lookat the simulated evolution of the radiation balance over land surfaces during the 20th century seems to confirm this. Specifically, only half of the models qualitatively reproduce the decrease in the terrestrial surface radiation balance between the 1950s and 1980s and the subsequent recovery as indicated in estimates based on observations. Quantitatively, from 1950 to 1985, the linear change in the model-calculated surface radiation balance is on average almost zero, as opposed to the observational evidence for declining surface radiation balance over this period (Wild et al 2004). Over the period 1985–2000, the multi-model mean amounts to an increase of 0.22 Wm-2 decade-1 (with a range from -0.10 to 0.57 Wm-2 decade-1, which is an order of magnitude smaller than for example the estimate given in Wild  et al (2008).Figure 2. Terrestrial precipitation anomalies during the 20th century as observed (in blue) and simulated by various models used in the IPCC 4th assessment report and in the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP3) (in red). Annual mean time series given as dashed lines, 11-year running means as solid lines. Reference period is the entire 20th century. Annual precipitation observations from GHCN (Peterson and Vose 1997), units mm.Truly global observational estimates of precipitation changes (covering both land and oceans) exist only since 1987 with the advent of satellite data from the Special Sensor Microwave Imager (SSM/I). Based on these observations, Wentz et al (2007) determined an increase in global mean precipitation of 13.2 +/- 4.8 mm yr-1 decade-1 over the period 1987–2006. To induce such an increase, which corresponds to a latent heat release of approximately 1 Wm-2 per decade, an increase in the globally averaged surface radiation balance of at least the same amount would be required accordingly. We obtained this estimate under the assumption of (1) an unchanged sensible heat flux and (2) an unchanged top of atmosphere radiation balance and corresponding surface heat uptake by the ocean and landmasses, so that globally the change in surface net radiation is balanced by the change in latent heat flux. Regarding assumption (1), the global mean sensible heat flux is an order of magnitude smaller than the latent heat flux, and therefore even large relative changes in sensible heating would be small in absolute terms. Assumption (2) is a conservative assumption and can be considered an upper limit because ocean and land heat uptake has likely subtracted a portion of the radiative energy available for evaporation (see, e.g., Hansen et al 2005) over recent decades. Therefore, if the Wentz et al (2007) estimated precipitation increase is unbiased, this would likely require a global mean surface radiation increase of more than 1 Wm-2 per decade (cf also the estimated 2 Wm-2 per decade increase in surface net radiation over land surfaces in Wild et al (2008)). Current climate models, on the other hand, show a much smaller average increase of less than 0.3 Wm-2 per decade.The underestimation of decadal scale variations in downward solar radiation and a lack of dimming and brightening in the models (Romanou et al 2007, Bodas-Salcedo et al  2008, Wild 2009b, Ruckstuhl and Norris 2009) could have affected the simulations of the surface radiation balance. While the response to the gradually increasing greenhouse gases in the thermal component of the surface energy balance is well understood and adequately simulated, much more uncertainties are apparent in the solar component. Since the hydrological cycle may respond particularly sensitive to non-homogeneous short-living types of solar forcings such as aerosols (see discussion above), the identification of the origins of the uncertainties in the solar forcings is of primary importance for predicting future changes. Uncertainties may be related to weaknesses in three areas: (1) Deficiencies in the parameterization of the relevant processes: aerosol–cloud interactions are still poorly understood and related model representations are subject to considerable uncertainties or entirely neglected. Note that only few models include the effects of aerosols on clouds, which dominate the hydrological response as shown in Romanou et al (2007). Furthermore, many models only consider the temporal variations in scattering sulphur aerosol and neglect changes in other aerosol types such as absorbing black carbon or desert dust, which would enhance the degree of freedom of aerosol–cloud interactions and change the stability of the atmosphere. (2) Uncertainties in the highly variable spatial and temporal distributions of global aerosol fields used in the 20th century simulations as e.g. shown by Ruckstuhl and Norris (2009). Also, most models still prescribe fixed spatial aerosol burdens in the atmosphere, rather than aerosol and aerosol precursor emission fields, which could enhance the degree of freedom of the global aerosol system.  (3) Shortcomings in the representation of the natural variability in atmosphere/ocean exchanges of energy and water that result in variations of convection and consequently in cloudiness and humidity. For example state-of-the-art climate models do not realistically reproduce decadal variations in the ocean atmosphere system such as Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO), Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation (AMO) or El Nino–Southern Oscillation (ENSO) that may have significant effects.ConclusionsTo summarize, we emphasize the prominent role of the surface radiation balance as a key determinant of the intensity of the global hydrological cycle. There are indications that the surface radiation balance underwent significant decadal variations during the 20th century, which are reflected in the variations of the intensity of the global hydrological cycle. The current generation of climate models does not show such strong variability in either of these quantities.   Here we point to the inadequate representation of surface solar dimming and brightening as a potential cause of these model deficiencies. This is further supported by the recent evidence that solar forcings are more effective in altering the intensity of the global hydrological cycle than their thermal (greenhouse-gas-forced) counterparts. Improved knowledge of variations of the components of the surface radiation balance as well as their underlying forcing factors are therefore key to our understanding of past, present and future variations in the intensity of the hydrological cycle.The recent implementation of advanced space-borne and surface-based monitoring systems should allow for more rigorous constraints of the radiative drivers behind the hydrological cycle. Together with improved modelling capabilities, including sophisticated interactive aerosol and cloud microphysics schemes, these advances should result in more realistic simulations and predictions of the intensity of the hydrological cycle in the near future.AcknowledgementsParticular thanks go to Professor Christoph Schär for his valuable input to the manuscript and for his support.

Coconut Creek (Florida), ISSN 0749-0208.Intelligent port logistics information analysis strategies and methods are of great value for improving port logistics information management and service quality, promoting the development of logistics information management theory, and promoting the application of information technology in logistics enterprises. With the gradual arrival of the data age, useful data behind a large amount of data needs to be mined. Data mining plays an important role in data analysis and is widely used in many fields. As the starting point and end point of maritime transportation, the junction point of various production factors and the junction point of important information, modern ports integrate commodity flow, information flow, capital flow and talent flow. In the long-term operation of port logistics, a large number of dynamic data have been accumulated. It has become a common cognition to strengthen the mining of these data values. According to the dynamic characteristics of port logistics information, this paper proposes an intelligent analysis strategy of port logistics information based on dynamic data mining technology.","https://www.proquest.com/docview/2812612225?accountid=44943&bdid=84593&_bd=QKbUS0kWqHHUC7XPBouNfVz9FdA%3D","https://doi.org/10.2112/JCR-SI115-028.1"
"SciDAC 2006","","","Journal of Physics: Conference Series","Scholarly Journals","","46","1","2006-01-01","Jan 2006","","","","17426588","","","ENG","The second annual Scientific Discovery through Advanced Computing (SciDAC) Conference was held from June 25–29, 2006 at the new Hyatt Regency Hotel in Denver, Colorado.  This conference showcased outstanding SciDAC-sponsored computational science results achieved during the past year across many scientific domains, with an emphasis on science at scale.   Exciting computational science that has been accomplished outside of the SciDAC program both nationally and internationally was also featured to help foster communication between SciDAC computational scientists and those funded by other agencies.  This was illustrated by many compelling examples of how domain scientists collaborated productively with applied mathematicians and computer scientists to effectively take advantage of terascale computers (capable of performing trillions of calculations per second) not only to accelerate progress in scientific discovery in a variety of fields but also to show great promise for being able to utilize the exciting petascale capabilities in the near future. The SciDAC program was originally conceived as an interdisciplinary computational science program based on the guiding principle that strong collaborative alliances between domain scientists, applied mathematicians, and computer scientists are vital to accelerated progress and associated discovery on the world's most challenging scientific problems.  Associated verification and validation are essential in this successful program, which was funded by the US Department of Energy Office of Science (DOE OS) five years ago.  As is made clear in many of the papers in these proceedings, SciDAC has fundamentally changed the way that computational science is now carried out in response to the exciting challenge of making the best use of the rapid progress in the emergence of more and more powerful computational platforms.  In this regard, Dr. Raymond Orbach, Energy Undersecretary for Science at the DOE and Director of the OS has stated:  `SciDAC has strengthened the role of high-end computing in furthering science.  It is defining whole new fields for discovery.'  (SciDAC Review, Spring 2006, p8).  Application domains within the SciDAC 2006 conference agenda encompassed a broad range of science including:  (i) the DOE core mission of energy research involving combustion studies relevant to fuel efficiency and pollution issues faced today and magnetic fusion investigations impacting prospects for future energy sources; (ii) fundamental explorations into the building blocks of matter, ranging from quantum chromodynamics – the basic theory that describes how quarks make up the protons and neutrons of all matter – to the design of modern high-energy accelerators; (iii) the formidable challenges of predicting and controlling the behavior of molecules in quantum chemistry and the complex biomolecules determining the evolution of biological systems; (iv) studies of exploding stars for insights into the nature of the universe; and (v) integrated climate modeling to enable realistic analysis of earth's changing climate.  Associated research has made it quite clear that advanced computation is often the only means by which timely progress is feasible when dealing with these complex, multi-component physical, chemical, and biological systems operating over huge ranges of temporal and spatial scales. Working with the domain scientists, applied mathematicians and computer scientists have continued to develop the discretizations of the underlying equations and the complementary algorithms to enable improvements in solutions on modern parallel computing platforms as they evolve from the terascale toward the petascale regime. Moreover, the associated tremendous growth of data generated from the terabyte to the petabyte range demands not only the advanced data analysis and visualization methods to harvest the scientific information but also the development of efficient workflow strategies which can deal with the data input/output, management, movement, and storage challenges.  If scientific discovery is expected to keep apace with the continuing progression from tera- to petascale platforms, the vital alliance between domain scientists, applied mathematicians, and computer scientists will be even more crucial.  During the SciDAC 2006 Conference, some of the future challenges and opportunities in interdisciplinary computational science were emphasized in the Advanced Architectures Panel and by Dr. Victor Reis, Senior Advisor to the Secretary of Energy, who gave a featured presentation on `Simulation, Computation, and the Global Nuclear Energy Partnership.'  Overall, the conference provided an excellent opportunity to highlight the rising importance of computational science in the scientific enterprise and to motivate future investment in this area.  As Michael Strayer, SciDAC Program Director, has noted:  `While SciDAC may have started out as a specific program, Scientific Discovery through Advanced Computing has become a powerful concept for addressing some of the biggest challenges facing our nation and our world.'  Looking forward to next year, the SciDAC 2007 Conference will be held from June 24–28 at the Westin Copley Plaza in Boston, Massachusetts. Chairman: David Keyes, Columbia University.The Organizing Committee for the SciDAC 2006 Conference would like to acknowledge the individuals whose talents and efforts were essential to the success of the meeting.

Collecting real-time data and detecting these objects using various sensors such as RADARs, Synthetic Aperture RADARs, and mounted RADARs present significant challenges due to numerous influencing factors. To address this issue, our research aims to develop an Internet of Things (IoT)-based multi-scale and multi-scene ship identification system. This system leverages a multi-scale neural network integrated with a high-response convolutional neural network (CNN)-based Kalman filter architecture. To construct this model, we selected various ship categories and initially employed a base CNN model to develop a new model with different convolutional layers. Our approach utilizes mixed methods for tracking and detecting objects, with a focus on small ships. The dataset is processed through multiple neural network layers, and we implemented the Kalman filter to estimate and predict the ships’ positions. Additionally, using the YOLOv3 model, we achieved improved accuracy and reduced error rates through mathematical optimization. Our method utilizes a dataset of 5,604 samples and incorporates a hybrid approach with YOLOv3. Our model demonstrates significant improvements for both medium-sized and small ships. The proposed work provides both qualitative and quantitative advancements. Our model exceeded the best results from parallel experiments by 3.9% and 1.2% in terms of Average Precision (AP). Furthermore, YOLOv3 achieved a performance score of 97.34% across various metric parameters, while our proposed approach attained the highest scores of 97.8% and 94.87%, respectively.","https://www.proquest.com/docview/3104475915?accountid=44943&bdid=84593&_bd=GdzLW1pQaBBQE%2Ff%2FJ504KJqpJQk%3D","https://doi.org/10.1007/s11760-024-03460-2"

Two hypotheses are advanced. Firstly, the number of cyclones reaching Northern Europe has increased, causing a transition to a more maritime climate. Secondly, the trajectories of cyclones have moved northward, causing the advection of warm and moist air to Northern Europe and decreasing precipitation in Central Europe. These advances were confirmed by data analysis. A linear trend and its statistical significance (P<0.05) for the frequency of cyclones in the Atlantic-European sector (30°W-45°E, 35-75°N) were calculated. Circles with radii of 500, 1000, 1500 and 2000 km with centre coordinates 60°N and 22.5°E were generated. All the cyclones whose centres were located within these circles were counted. Also two meridians −5°E and 20°E - were selected and all the cyclones were counted whose centres crossed the meridians from west to east in the interval of 45-75°N. Changes in the frequency of long-term cyclones were analysed. The number of cyclones reaching Northern Europe has increased in the period 1948-2000. The number of cyclones over the Baltic Sea has increased, especially in the winter. In Central Europe, the number of cyclones has decreased, especially in the warm half-year.

In this paper, data analysis and text mining techniques, technology opportunity analysis (TOA) and technology-service evolution analysis (TSEA) have been applied to analyze and observe IoT technologies’ and services’ evolution. Academic journals, market reports, and patents have been collected and reviewed on the topic of IoT in the logistics field in this paper. Moreover, by using TOA, technology opportunities have been analyzed to explore IoT-related logistics services. The results of TOA, for example, show that cloud technology is essential to develop smart logistics services, and communication RFID technologies are key to developing information logistics services. Finally, TSEA enables the observation of IoT technology and logistics service evolution by combining unstructured and semi-structured data from text documents. Observing the results of TSEA, the evolution of IoT in logistics is identified, and the results of TSEA also confirm those of TOA using unstructured or semi-structured text data from documents only.

However, during the detection and recognition process, QR code images are frequently impacted by external elements, including recording equipment, light, and filming angle, which causes fuzzy QR codes that cannot be read to provide accurate information. This research presents a quick deblurring technique (Gs-DeblurGANv2) based on lightweight networks to fix the potential blurring issue with QR images in real-world applications. The approach is based on the generative adversarial network concept, where the generative network employs the GhostNet lightweight module as the feature extraction network and introduces the feature pyramid structure, while the addition of the SKNet attention module optimizes the feature extraction from images. In addition, PatchGAN is used as the discriminative network and a dual-scale discriminator for global image and local features is set. Trained and tested under the QR code blurred dataset, the results show that Gs-DeblurGANv2 achieves 25.21 dB and 0.87 PSNR and SSIM for the deblurred images and the original HD images on the test set, and this result is better than previous research methods. The outcomes of the experiments demonstrate that the proposed Gs-DeblurGANv2 can efficiently make use of the feature information of QR code pictures and produce more effective deblurring performance.","https://www.proquest.com/docview/2973143966?accountid=44943&bdid=84593&_bd=YhelnSVE%2BX2nfscqylK3sAOe18g%3D","https://doi.org/10.1007/s00530-024-01292-1"

Presently, there are some commercial machines available for nylon rope winding onto a shipping reel before shipment. However, they still need manual operation relying on rapid movement of the hands, also requiring full coordination with the winding action. This operation procedure makes it very difficult to continuously achieve the winding process fast and accurately due to high dependence on human operation but also some forms of diameter deviation occurred from the chemical process. In reality, even a slight human mistake may result in uneven winding outcome. Therefore, an adaptive reeling schedule method using a simple algebra computation is developed to resolve this problem. For this reason, an automatic rope winding control system to adaptively suit various rope diameters with an error involved is developed using adaptive decision-making (ADM) algorithm based on a simple arithmetic operation. First, the winding turn in each layer of drum is obtained from the quotient of the drum length divided by average rope diameter of each layer. Second, through the accumulated winding turn divided by the winding turn of a layer, the quotient represents the number of winding layers, and the remainder is the current winding turn of the layer. Third, the turning location to instantly swift to forward or backward winding direction is therefore determined when the winding turn reaches the target of each layer. The proposed model is realized on the basis of automation mechanism integrated with programming logical controller (PLC), human machine interface (HMI), optical micrometer, server motor, linear motor, tension sensor and optical motor, etc. The experimental results verify that the proposed system can reach 100% reality performance in the rope diameters of 3.8 mm, 4.0 mm, and 6.5 mm. Compared with the traditional winding method taking 15 min, the operation time is reduced to 11 min. Accordingly, it is confirmed that the proposed system is superior to traditional human-handling machines in term of rapidness, robustness, and accuracy.","https://www.proquest.com/docview/3118114319?accountid=44943&bdid=84593&_bd=LFP4%2F1PA03jKxEEArgW5iry%2B4WY%3D","https://doi.org/10.1007/s00170-024-14592-7"

One of the challenges is that work-related injuries are characteristically underreported and undertreated. Complications of wound infection, joint deformity, loss of function, and transmission of acute disease from exposure to bodily fluids can be minimized by accurate early assessment and proper evidence-based treatment and surveillance. This poster identified occupations at risk for human bites and discussed the role of the occupational health nurse in early reporting, administering immediate wound care, and initiating hepatitis B and tetanus immunizations. This poster was the result of an extensive literature review of human bites in the occupational setting.It is estimated that Australian health care workers sustain more than 18,500 needlestick injuries per year (Murphy, 2008). Inherently preventable, these injuries cause significant personal, social, and economic distress for health care workers and have an economic impact to Western Australia (WA) Health via lost productivity and treatment and recovery costs. In February 2008, research was conducted by the product liaison officer into the use of safety engineered medical devices (SEMDs) in Australia, finding that no states mandated their use. In April 2009, a WA Safety Sharps Forum was initiated by the Occupational Safety & Health (OSH) Nursing team with the aim of developing a strategy whereby SEMDs would be mandated, extending with time to all WA Health Care Units. At the same time, the state government of WA issued a 7% cut in spending across all agencies. Agencies reacted by restricting new programs. Despite this, OSH Nursing continued to implement the SEMDs, commencing with a pilot trial completely substituting standard sharps devices in five acute clinical areas. The outcome was a significant downward trend of needlestick injuries, which continues, to below the Australian Council on Healthcare needlestick injury national benchmark. This study validates this program's success in reducing the incidence of needlestick injuries among health care workers.Although hypertension is highly prevalent, associated with serious health consequences, but treatable, fewer than half of those with hypertension have achieved hypertension control (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2011). Epidemiological evidence supports the claim that psychological factors such as job satisfaction, life satisfaction, perceived stress, and perceived health status can mediate and negatively influence health behaviors associated with hypertension (Blanchflower & Oswald, 2008; Kulkarni, Farrel, Erasi, & Kochar, 1998; Walcott-McQuigg, 2000). However, few have studied how these factors affect hypertension control. Given the significant influence of workers' health on their overall well-being and work productivity, it is important to understand the impact these factors have on blood pressure control. Opportunities for intervention exist if psychological factors, which may place individuals with high blood pressure at risk for poor pressure control, can be identified. This proposed study will examine the role of perceived stress, job satisfaction, life satisfaction, and perceived health status in the development of uncontrolled hypertension among municipal employees of the city of Birmingham, Alabama. This study is a secondary analysis of cross-sectional data collected in a health screening questionnaire by The Good Health Program, which conducts regularly scheduled health screenings. Findings from the study should lead to future targeted interventions designed to increase hypertension control (and thereby reduce cardiovascular morbidity) among municipal workers.This poster described basic rabies facts, including incidence, prevention, symptoms, and postexposure prophylaxis. The poster emphasized exposure among deployed personnel and incidence in current theaters of operation. The poster also provided a case study of a soldier who died of rabies presumably after being bitten by a dog in theater. The poster described the Army National Guard's execution of a potential rabies exposure screening task from the Public Health Command, including challenges, successes, and issues unique to the Army National Guard.Changes in swine production methods during the past 25 years have resulted in an environment that increases workers' exposure to airborne ammonia and particulate matter. A task-associated analysis of ammonia and particulate matter concentrations was conducted on swine farms in breeding and gestation barns. The purpose of this study was to determine if specific tasks performed by workers increased concentrations of ammonia and particulate matter. A convenient sample of 8 workers was selected from all breeding and gestation workers (n  = 24). Data collection occurred in the morning at each of the eight farms and continued until tasks were completed (4 hours). The results suggested a significant interactive effect for the type of confinement barn and the type of tasks the workers were performing. The workers' risk of exposure to particulate matter depended on the type of task they performed in a particular barn. Agricultural occupational health nurses can use this information to implement interventions appropriate to minimize worker exposures. Exposure could be reduced if workers were informed of conditions that require the use of personal protective equipment. When personal protective equipment is recommended, the occupational health nurse can ensure the proper selection and fit-testing of appropriate equipment.As one of the largest industries in the United States, health care employs a diverse and aging population. Health care personnel face a multitude of risks, both physical and emotional, that could result in occupational injuries. Health care is considered high risk for occupational injuries due to the variety of hazards present in the workplace. Hazards faced each day by health care personnel include biological, chemical, radiological, and ergonomic hazards, needlesticks, lasers, stress (including emotional/psychological and physical/musculoskeletal), and workplace violence. Left unchecked, workers' compensation costs could rise out of control, placing a financial burden on the industry due to lost time, escalating health care costs, and lost productivity during this time of health care reform. An effective and successful workers' compensation program must include strategies around injury prevention and control. Elements of prevention include commitment from leadership and key stakeholders, effective policies and procedures, ongoing data analysis, and effective interventions targeted at high-risk hazards. Controlling access to timely evidence-based care and disciplined oversight of health care and claims processes are necessary. Using a standardized, methodical approach to prevent and control work-related injuries in the health care setting can result in a 54% reduction in claims frequency, a 74% reduction in workers' compensation costs for wages, a 58% reduction in lost time, and a 65% reduction in incurred costs.More than 100 million American workers, 7 million workplaces, and 945,000 hazardous chemical products are covered by the Hazard Communication Standard (HCS). The Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) established the HCS to ensure that workers are informed of the hazardous chemicals with which they work, yet OSHA representatives admit that many adults may have difficulty reading hazard communication materials. Only 12% of adults surveyed in the United States demonstrated proficient health literacy; this poses a serious problem for hazard communication. The purpose of this study was to examine literacy levels as a hypothesized moderator of test scores of employees presenting to a local occupational health clinic for physical examination, immunization, drug screening, or a monitoring appointment. Comprehensibility was measured by a test based on seven separate Material Safety Data Sheets (MSDSs) for sodium hypochlorite. Literacy levels were measured using the Short Test of Functional Health Literacy in Adults (STOFHLA). The readability level of the written material was measured using the Simplified Measure of Gobbledygook (SMOG) and the Flesch-Kincaid Grade Level (FKGL). Age, highest grade level completed, native language, and job category were measured by a demographic survey. The results indicated a significant positive correlation between the total STOFHLA scores and the total scores on the MSDS test. Findings comparing the readability of the MSDS examples to the participant's overall MSDS score were inconclusive. However, the format of the MSDSs, specifically the number of lines per sentence and number of words three syllables or more, may influence comprehension.According to the World Health Organization, hypertension is the leading cause of death in the world and is a primary reason that individuals seek health care. Combined interventions to promote adherence have been promising, but further research is needed to understand which behaviors to target. The frequency of self-monitoring of blood pressure among workers is unknown and information about assessing hypertensive individuals' readiness and confidence to engage in medication adherence is limited in the literature. The purpose of this study was to determine the prevalence of medication adherence, readiness, self-efficacy, self-monitoring of blood pressure, and blood pressure control in a specific group of workers, municipal employees. The study population (N  = 149) was participants in a wellness program established more than 20 years earlier to promote health and safety in a large municipal work force in the southeastern United States. The majority of the study participants (75.70%) demonstrated controlled blood pressure, reported adherence to antihypertensive medication (70%), and used self-monitoring of blood pressure (70%). The vast majority of the study participants (88.50%) were in the maintenance stage (Transtheoretical Model) and almost half (47.8%) reported high medication adherence self-efficacy. Overall, only 22.8% of the current study participants were aware of the target blood pressure goal recommended by the national guidelines, and only 7.5% of the study participants were taking diuretics. These findings are important for developing targeted blood pressure control interventions.The Institute of Medicine (2011) report, ""Occupational Health Nurses and Respiratory Protection: Improving Education and Training,"" outlined seven recommendations to improve the competency of occupational health nurses in respiratory protection. An advisory board was convened in December 2011, with stakeholder representation from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention/National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health/National Personal Protective Technology Laboratory, American Association of Occupational Health Nurses, Inc., American Board for Occupational Health Nurses, Association of Occupational Health Professionals in Healthcare, American Nurses Association, and Institute of Medicine Standing Committee on Personal Protective Equipment for Workplace Safety and Health. Two recommendations guided the initial work of the advisory committee, including (a) conducting focus groups and administering a survey to assess current occupational health nurse roles and responsibilities relevant to respiratory protection and education and training needs; and (b) determining how occupational health nurses achieve and maintain knowledge and skills in respiratory protection and how occupational health nurses motivate employees to use respirators appropriately. Strategies for addressing the report will be presented, as well as preliminary survey development. The work of the advisory group will be used to develop innovative curricular materials to augment the education of occupational health nurses regarding all aspects of a respiratory protection program. Future goals include (a) educating all levels of nurses in respiratory protection and (b) developing interdisciplinary core competencies in respiratory protection for occupational health and safety professional education.Oil spills are manmade disasters that can have both short-term and long-term adverse health effects on the workers who provide containment and decontamination. These ""temporary"" workers may be from the local area or may travel from other states and regions to assist. Some represent individuals who are forced out-of-work by the disaster (e.g., fishermen, hotel and restaurant staff from resort areas). The risk to workers derives from several sources, including exposure to the oil, dispersants, and the work environment (e.g., heat, humidity, unfamiliar personal protective equipment, stress from family separation, loss of regular income, and stress from witnessing the destruction of human life, property, and wildlife). A brief historical overview of oil spills is presented. Short-term and long-term mental and physical health effects are discussed. Occupational health nurses should be encouraged to include assessment about this type of temporary employment activity during employment histories because many workers may not recall this type of temporary work after the disaster subsides.A customized work screen was developed by the joint efforts of the Ergonomics, Environmental Health and Safety Department, Legal, Occupational Health, Human Resources, and the staff and managers of the Patient Transport Department. The diverse nature of the participants contributed to the development of a customized work screening for potential transport employees that was fair to all genders, ages, and levels of experience. The customized work screening program was implemented for all new employees in the Patient Transport Department to identify employees at risk for injury. The program resulted in an immediate and long-standing reduction in the number and severity of injuries among Patient Transport Department employees.If you build a great educational meeting, they will come. Using the analogy of a baseball game, learn how to make your meetings comfortable and fun so the fans will attend.Domestic violence is a leading cause of injury in the workplace and one of the leading causes of violence against women in the workplace. Intimate partner violence prevents victims, primarily women, from attaining the economic security that would enable them to escape the violence--many times adversely affecting their workplace performance, attendance, and behaviors. Occupational health nurses and associated staff play an important role in screening, early detection, advocacy, and effective intervention. A domestic violence toolkit with a requisite training program was designed and implemented in 2011 for occupational health nurses. This toolkit can positively impact all employees whether they are directly or indirectly involved in intimate partner and workplace violence. This intervention extends the company's service promise to its employees. Implementation of this program has shown positive outcomes. The staff have internalized the process to confidently use conflict resolution skills as well as hold individuals accountable for their part in the process. The company has strengthened this partnership with the Employee Assistance Program offering long-term support for affected employees via counseling, both telephonic and on-site. The occupational health nurses foster health and well-being through strategic consultation, education, coaching, and monitoring during every employee encounter as they provide care, support services, and direction for domestic violence victims. With this domestic violence toolkit, the occupational health nurses aim to remove barriers and provide workable solutions, support, and resources for all employees, including those touched by domestic or workplace violence.""Injuries and musculoskeletal disorders (MSDs) are common in nurses and are often caused by lifting and moving patients. This is more than just an inconvenience; injuries are often life altering and career ending. Additionally, improper handling of patients is expensive and costs the United States over $7 billion each year in workers' compensation costs, medical bills, and staff replacements"" (American Nurses Association). Nurses are continuously exposed to back injury risks because of the demands of their jobs. Patient care as well as prolonged desk work are potentially damaging to their bodies; in addition, the average age of nurses has increased to around 40 years. ""It is estimated that 12% of nurses leave the profession annually due to back injuries, and 52% complain of chronic back pain"" (Mockaki, 2009). Previously sustained approaches such as body mechanics and lift training have been demonstrated to be ineffective. This project adds a new twist to the issue by making the focus wellness and self-protection instead of ""safety regulations"" and combining multidisciplinary interventions (i.e., adequate equipment, wellness classes and activities, and individual/team incentives) to reduce the incidence of back injury as well as its impact on nurses' quality of life.Employee wellness initiatives are critical to employees determining their risks for serious illness, such as heart disease, diabetes, and stroke. Workplace wellness programs can provide a valuable venue for health promotion. A new worksite wellness program for health care workers was initiated to identify risk factors for heart disease, stroke, and diabetes. On-site health screenings included height, weight, and body mass index calculation, blood pressure, and total cholesterol and hemoglobin A1c. Screening was available at multiple facilities and times. All employees received a written laboratory report and an explanation letter. Emergency department or physician referrals were made as needed. Employees were notified immediately about any critical laboratory values. Employees were also encouraged to seek testing through their own provider. Preliminary results included the total number of individuals screened and biometric data. Employee engagement and physician partnership were also outcomes. Convenient, free, confidential workplace health screenings can facilitate employee participation and engagement in self-care. Use of hemoglobin A1c and other biometrics can provide critical information regarding diabetes status and risk for heart disease and stroke. Workplace wellness programs promote self-efficacy and potentially identify risk factors for disease. Measuring these biometrics can assist in targeting future programs.For more than 20 years, Genentech Health Services has managed an Employee Donation Program, providing researchers with fresh blood, urine, and saliva samples. This program is managed by an Occupational Health Program Manager/nurse practitioner and requires annual Institutional Review Board approval, as well as marketing and recruitment, financial oversight, and continuous quality assurance. Providing human samples is critical to Genentech research for two reasons: freshness of the samples and ability to recall specific donors. Many research programs at Genentech would not be possible if not for the Employee Donation Program. Approximately 200 employees donate samples on a regular basis. Key components of this program include confidentiality and informed consent. Employee Donation Program staff complete human subjects training and the program is conducted as a clinical trial.Wellness programs are integral to an increasing number of work environments. These programs may include discounted ""healthy choice"" items in the company lunch room, nutrition education, tobacco cessation presentations, and incentives for participation in fitness classes. However, what is often missing from generic wellness services is an individualized approach to each employee's specific health and wellness needs. To individualize and personalize their wellness focus, employers and insurance companies may collaborate to offer free or low-cost health and wellness assessments provided by a third party. Typically, wellness companies offer online health risk assessments (HRAs), health review, and wellness coaching that occur via e-mail or telephone, and online educational programs. This poster described tailored services, an online HRA, and an on-site program for health screening (biometric screening and laboratory tests). These services are followed by a face-to-face, on-site health review of the individual's personal health report, which fuels the first step toward wellness: awareness of the employee's state of health. Health coaching, also face-to-face, is then provided on-site quarterly for the convenience of employees. The vendor supports the wellness goals of both the employer and the employee by providing on-site education about health improvement and motivation for ongoing health maintenance.The Community Heart Program (CHP) assesses cardiovascular health. Through the provision of health screenings and education, the program seeks to bring long-term health and health care benefits to an under-served and at-risk population. Community members receive free cardiovascular heart disease risk factor screenings and health coaching for lifestyle modification aimed at cardiovascular heart disease prevention. Access to this service is offered at worksites and during community events. Relatives of cardiac intervention patients are also offered screening opportunities, raising the awareness that cardiovascular heart disease can be a familial disease. Hence, the CHP affords community members an opportunity to understand and pursue their own optimal heart health. The screenings include a heart-health history and biometric data (i.e., glucose, total cholesterol, high-density lipoproteins, and total cholesterol/high-density lipoprotein ratio, blood pressure, waist-to-hip ratio, and body mass index). Cigarette smokers receive a breath carbon monoxide screening. Once the data have been collected, the participant receives a Framingham Cardiac Risk Score. Counseling is provided by a trained Risk Factor Counselor. When findings are outside of national guidelines, a referral for care is recommended and a letter is sent to the participant's primary care provider. If the participant is lacking a primary care provider, assistance is offered in locating one. A database of participants is maintained for comparison and statistical analysis. Aggregate screening data for each participating worksite are monitored and group summary reports are generated for comparison to national norms. As a continuing program, the accumulated database provides unique analytic capabilities and opportunities for research.More than 20.4 million adults are diagnosed with substance dependence or abuse in the United States. An alarming 2.9% report working while under the influence of an illicit drug. Substance abuse costs U.S. employers more than $276 billion each year, with costs stemming from lost productivity, workplace accidents, and increased health care and insurance costs. Given by an experienced registered nurse and an occupational medicine physician, this presentation provided occupational health nurses with a guide to managing a modern drug testing program. The presenters provided information about the most common prescription medications (e.g., opiates, barbiturates) and illicit drugs (e.g., marijuana, methamphetamine) abused in the workplace, common drug interactions, the challenges of medical marijuana in the workplace, the benefits of a corporate drug testing program, new drug testing options that detect the ""latest"" street drugs (e.g., synthetic marijuana), and the elements of an appropriate policy and procedure.Since the ""Omnibus Transportation Employee Test Act of 1991,"" regulations published by the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration (FMCSA) prohibit the use of controlled substances in the workplace. A close review of the regulations and amendments through 2010 continues to emphasize the importance of maintaining a drug-free workplace. Based on the need for these federally regulated programs, the Department of Transportation issued, ""Procedures for Transportation Workplace Drug and Alcohol Testing Programs."" The six agencies in the industry, FAA-Aviation, FMCSA-Motor Carrier, FRA-Railroad, FTA-Transit, PHMSA-Pipelines, and USCG Maritime, may have separate regulations specific to the work done by their employees. However, if employed in a safety-sensitive position, workers must be enrolled in a federally regulated drug testing program. By defining the dynamics of a well-planned Drug and Alcohol Testing Program, compliance could be maintained by using evidence-based methods.More than ever before, safety and health are at the nucleus of organizational cost-saving initiatives. The Occupational Safety and Health Administration's renewed focus on compliance and the need to control loss served as the impetus for organizations to employ a safety and health management system (S&HMS) approach for workplace safety. This session discussed the occupational health nurse's role in building a mature S&HMS.Cleaning workers are exposed to various occupational hazards while performing physically demanding tasks and handling various materials. Cleaning work is among the jobs with higher rates of occupational injuries. The purpose of this study was to describe self-reported occupational injuries among cleaning workers and examine the relationships among self-reported occupational injuries, demographics, and job factors. This cross-sectional study recruited 183 cleaning workers at a university hospital and medical sciences campus between May and December 2011. Personal interviews and self-administered questionnaires were used to collect data on demographics, job characteristics, and occupational injuries. Logistic regression was used to assess factors associated with self-reported occupational injuries. The majority of the study participants were female (56%), foreign-born (86%), and Asian (65%). About 20% reported experiencing occupational injuries in the past 12 months. Arms (35%) and hands (29%) were the most commonly affected parts of the body. Of those who reported injuries, 71% sought health care, 41% missed work due to the injury, and 74% reported the injury to a supervisor. Workers with a college education were more likely to report occupational injuries than others (38.5% vs. 10.7%; odds ratio = 5.2, 95% confidence interval = 2.4 to 11.5). Injury reporting was more common among U.S.-born, female, younger, and dayshift workers, but the findings were not statistically significant. The most commonly reported were upper-extremity injuries. Only education was a significant predictor of self-reported occupational injuries. Further study with a large sample is suggested.Nurses provide care to residents and workers on America's 2.2 million farms. Nurse educators are challenged to find opportunities to teach agricultural health and safety content to nursing students. The purpose of this poster was to illustrate how three components of education were interwoven across multiple research projects and educational units and grounded by community stakeholder engagement. Two National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health-funded studies provided the opportunity to engage undergraduate nursing students and faculty at two universities and the regional Area Health Education Center to explore health promotion theories, engage in research and service, and learn about agricultural health and safety and how it applies to nursing practice. Each institution had a unique role in the project. Involvement included development, delivery, and evaluation of instructional interventions at Progressive Agriculture Foundation Safety Days® . The mix of research, education, and community organizations produced a tapestry of interdisciplinary work that quickly permeated nursing practice, education, and community service and initially reached 553 members of a rural community. This symbiotic interaction between two nursing educational programs (service learning and undergraduate research interns) yielded valuable service-learning and research products that could not have been achieved without students' participation. At the end of the project, students indicated they applied their new knowledge to practice after graduation and the Safety Day incorporated new techniques. With thoughtful planning, content related to agricultural health and safety can be infused into undergraduate education. Nurses need to be properly informed about the health hazards of agriculture to provide culturally competent care.This poster presentation shared successful experiences in creating a thriving and exciting worksite wellness program. The Healthy Worksite Award concept fosters friendly and healthy competition between Raytheon locations across the country. This award gives an Olympic feel to competitors with levels of gold, silver, and bronze. By engaging company leadership, increasing employee involvement, and exemplifying overall wellness, three presenters from various regions of the United States shared their expertise as past and present Gold Medal winners of Raytheon's annual Healthy Worksite Awards.The dynamic interactions among organizational mission and culture, occupational subcultures, workplace practices, and worker performance were presented as the basis for a theoretical model derived from Schein's notion of culture and the Congruence Model of Organizational Behavior, which describes factors that contribute to the development of an injury-free environment. Occupational health nursing's fundamental value and belief is that employees have the right to a safe work environment. Important aspects of the occupational health nurse's leadership role are to facilitate workplace behaviors that promote worker adherence to safe standard processes, train workers to identify and prevent safety risks, and identify and address environmental barriers to safe and effective workplace practices. To achieve this ideal safe and injury-free workplace, the occupational health nurse must understand and evaluate the environmental influences, such as systems and resources, in combination with the influence of both the organizational culture and the occupational subcultures on workers' performance. Six core dimensions of occupational culture (behaviors, expectations, communication, teamwork, job satisfaction, and professional commitment) reflect shared values, beliefs, and norms that guide workers' actions and interactions. Together, these core dimensions set the stage for implementation of workplace practices in which workers adhere to standard processes and engage in workplace behaviors that lead to worker safety. By aligning occupational culture and organizational expectations, worker safety behaviors can be promoted and the ideal safety environment created.The United Kingdom has reached concensus that current specialist training programs are not preparing nurses to anticipate the challenges of emerging occupational health practice. The development of new training programs and advanced nurse practitioner roles provides a potential solution. Almost all nursing education takes place within the National Health Service (NHS); however, occupational health is relatively unique in that most posts are outside the NHS and most education is likely to be outside the NHS (although no data confirm this). Nurses registered in a database as working in occupational health were invited to participate in an online survey in September 2011 to assess the potential role of advanced nursing practice in occupational health. A secondary objective was to collate information on the distribution of occupational health nurses across business sectors and measure levels of specialist nurse training. Almost 1,000 occupational health nurses responded, approximately one fourth of all occupational health nurses in the United Kingdom. A significant majority of occupational health nurses believed that almost all generic advanced nursing practice competencies were important in current and future occupational health nursing practice. Occupational health nurses considered all the advanced nursing practice competencies more important in the future. Only 2% of occupational health nurses considered all advanced nursing practice competencies unimportant. Only about 30% of occupational health nurses were employed in the health care sector. Occupational health nurses recognized that advanced nursing practice competencies are important to their current and future practice. Enthusiasm in occupational health nursing for the introduction of advanced nursing practice has been found.The housekeeping departments of medical centers frequently experience high injury rates compared to other departments. A wellness data review reported more than two thirds of the department were either overweight or obese. Literature review supported a relationship between obesity and injuries. This research was conducted during 1 year, with nutrition education presented at each department meeting. Twenty-four percent (n  = 48) of the housekeeping department completed both pre- and post-intervention personal wellness profiles. Comparison of the self-reported pre- and post-intervention personal wellness profile results showed an increase in nutrition and fitness status, a decrease in the use of sick days, a decrease in alcohol use, a decrease in blood pressure, improved weight status, and an increase in doing well overall. Work-related injuries decreased by 12%. This research study demonstrated that nutrition educational sessions are effective in improving nutrition knowledge. Although the body mass index was not lowered significantly, evidence exists via the results of the post-intervention personal wellness profile that employees were paying attention to the nutrition educational sessions. Changing health behaviors is never a quick process, but the researchers believe that a continuation of this program with this particular group of employees could yield significant improvements in their health status over several years.Electronic medical records provide an efficient, paperless, cost-saving system of patient medical record management that is being implemented in health care settings worldwide. An electronic medical record in the occupational health setting provides the additional benefits of facilitating compliance with federal and state regulatory agencies, managing surveillance requirements, and promoting health and wellness programs. With electronic medical record implementation failure rates near 73%, the decision to convert to an electronic medical record in an occupational health clinic requires careful, deliberate consideration and planning. The goal of this poster was to define the critical components of electronic medical record implementation in the occupational health setting. The essential steps are to define the clinic goals and expectations of the electronic medical record, ensure staff readiness, incorporate change management processes, select the right vendor, plan a system design that supports clinical workflow, and standardize clinical practice. In addition, policy development that addresses confidentiality, system security, integration with other clinical electronic systems (e.g., laboratories, radiology), and maintenance and future system upgrades must be incorporated. With the advent of federal legislation driving the use of electronic medical records in hospital and ambulatory practices, clinical data (e.g., allergies, medications, immunizations) collected and stored in an occupational health electronic medical record must be standardized and structured to be exchanged (termed interoperability) with outside providers. The successful implementation of an electronic medical record in occupational health will be realized by a well-defined vision, dedicated leadership, realistic financial backing, committed staff, and a team of clinical and technical experts. Occupational health needs to prepare for this inevitable change in health care delivery.The workplace is no longer a venue for employees 20, 30, or 40 years old; some are reaching 60 or 70 as well. With fewer retirements, workers are staying employed for much longer periods. The older generation is slowing down, but their mental status is good. The middle-aged group is stymied because their chance for advancement has decreased or they are concerned about being ""downsized."" The younger generation would like just to enter the work force. This presentation demonstrated the obstacles and challenges that the occupational health nurse encounters when tending to the needs of all employees as well as employers.Individuals are dying of carbon monoxide poisoning, a silent killer. In the United States, carbon monoxide poisoning is the leading cause of accidental death by poisoning. Many cases of carbon monoxide poisoning go unreported or undiagnosed. Several safety measures should be followed to decrease the incidence of carbon monoxide poisoning. Carbon monoxide is a colorless, odorless, tasteless, highly toxic gas. It attacks without warning. The toxic gas is produced by the incomplete combustion of fuel-burning devices such as motor vehicles, gas-powered furnaces, and portable generators. The public must be educated about the potential health hazards of improperly using a portable generator when left without electrical power. Families, friends, and neighbors must be protected from carbon monoxide poisoning. Occupational health nurses can provide education to prevent potential poisoning.Health care is an evolving industry; new ways to deliver high-quality service while maintaining cost-effectiveness must be developed. The Township of Hamilton Rescue partnered with a local business (Viking Yachts) to form a uniquely cost-effective model. Family nurse practitioners function independently in rural environments. Primary and urgent care are available to all 55 members of the Township of Hamilton Rescue and their families. After-hours care is extended to the employees and families of Viking Yachts. Viking provides supplies and vaccines, Township of Hamilton Rescue provides the facilities, and a family nurse practitioner provides primary care in a direct billed/reimbursed system that is well received. Unique points include (1) clients are treated with medications from several low-cost sources (e.g., the Walmart $4 list, Shop Rite free antibiotic and diabetes medication lists); (2) clients and their families interact with a therapy dog at every visit; and (3) social and electronic media are used to maintain contact and improve care. The goal for this poster was to have nurses identify problems they face and offer them the tools to find unique solutions.Nursing aides, orderlies, attendants, and registered nurses are in the top 10 job categories for work-related musculoskeletal disorders. The University of Michigan is a Level III trauma center and employs thousands of nurses and assistive personnel. During the past several years, the health system invested in state-of-the-art patient handling equipment, a 24-hour lift team, and an employee injury monitoring system. Despite these interventions, the health system continued to experience unacceptable rates of back injuries related to patient handling. A comprehensive literature review, budget records, and employee injury data were used to analyze the cost-effectiveness of the back injury prevention program at the health system. Results were used to generate recommendations for continuous quality improvement of health care worker back health at this institution.Building on its work as a system, MedStar Health began a journey to increase flu vaccinations among its associates in 2006. Vaccinating staff with the influenza vaccine is a component of pandemic planning and protects patients. In a pandemic, more individuals need vaccinations. Building the vaccination infrastructure better positions hospitals to use a peer-peer approach that encourages unit-based licensed staff to give the flu vaccine locally. However, using several types of campaign strategies to increase vaccination (i.e., rolling carts, education, and peer vaccinators), the MedStar vaccination rate never increased over 54%. In 2009, MedStar mandated flu vaccinations. Associates, including all affiliated physicians, were allowed to refuse with a religious or health-related exemption; otherwise, if they chose not to be vaccinated, they were terminated for non-compliance. Physicians choosing not to become vaccinated had their admitting privileges suspended during the influenza season. For the past 3 years, the nine system hospitals have achieved a 99.9% compliance rate and a 98.4% vaccination rate. Only 1.5% of associates received health-related exemptions and less than .05% received religious exemptions. Since the adoption of the program, the Joint Commission's standards were updated to include a goal of a 90% vaccination rate. In addition, the America Hospital Association has also endorsed mandatory influenza policies. Mandating flu vaccinations has been found to be a successful strategy in achieving vaccination rates greater than 90%. Details on the data and strategies were presented.This presentation reported on how work influences hypertension management among Haitian immigrant hotel housekeepers. Hypertension is highly prevalent and poorly controlled among Haitian immigrants. Hotel housekeeping is one of the most common sources of employment for this immigrant group. How work influences hypertension management among Haitian immigrants must be explored. In this critical ethnographic study, 31 Haitian hotel housekeepers were recruited from Miami Dade County, Florida. Atlas Ti and SPSS software were used to analyze the interview transcripts and demographic data. Influences of work on hypertension management were found at both the individual and system levels. The individual level included coworker dynamics and maintenance of transmigrant life through work. The system level included supervisor support, workload, work pace, and work hiring practice. Each category within each of the levels had both positive and negative influences on hypertension management. These findings addressed several areas that could improve hypertension management among workers. Studies are needed to determine whether work influences on hypertension management pertain only to hotel housekeeping or to workers in other industries as well. Health care providers can account for these factors when caring for Haitian immigrant hotel housekeepers and other immigrant groups.A cross-sectional study was conducted to determine the health characteristics of mariners who completed a U.S. Coast Guard physical at a Regional Medical Center from 2003 to 2010. Variables included self-reported smoking status, body mass index, fasting lipids, glucose, and triglyceride levels, blood pressure, treadmill time, and maximal oxygen uptake measured using the Bruce Protocol. Major health conditions related to lifestyle and risk for metabolic syndrome were assessed. Participants had high prevalence of obesity (61.2%), smoking (41.3%), elevated triglycerides (41.7%), low high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (47.4%), hypertension (41.8%), and elevated fasting glucose (22.0%) and three or more metabolic syndrome risks (38.5%). Participants exhibited a high prevalence of chronic disease risk factors and could benefit from health promotion programs aimed at improving health and fitness.This study investigated the quality of hypertension management for individuals in company clinics, managed by primary care providers with clinic support. The purpose of the study was to improve the quality of care for workers. The researchers used a tool to apply quality measurement to the practice and then used the resulting data to develop actions to improve care. The data demonstrated competence in system-based practice and practice-based learning and improvement, and substantiated the quality of care delivered. Hypertension management was chosen as a significant health issue to evaluate given the prevalence and cost associated with the condition. The performance goal was that treatment for employees with diagnosed hypertension would meet guidelines from the Joint National Committee on Prevention, Detection, Evaluation, and Treatment of High Blood Pressure. Data collection and analysis were conducted by the staff. No employees completely met the performance goal, so corrective actions were implemented. A template for hypertension management was created in the electronic medical record. Staff education was offered. Medical records were audited 6 to 9 months after initial data collection. Presence of a recorded urine microalbumin increased from 8% to 88%. Recorded instruction on the DASH Diet increased from 42% to 92%. Future corrective actions include developing an automatic alert system in the electronic medical record for employees with a history of hypertension and completion of the hypertension template in semi-annual peer reviews.In the event of a pandemic, health care institutions should be prepared to vaccinate large numbers of faculty, staff, students, and families in a short period. To accomplish this, a southern private university followed the Hospital Incident Command System. To test its emergency preparedness plan, they initiated an annual influenza vaccination program by engaging employees' participation in an exciting event called ""Flulapalooza."" Flulapalooza was planned to test the strengths and weaknesses of the existing mass vaccination/mass prophylaxis plan and to use this information to ensure the plan could be implemented successfully in the event of a pandemic. The staff chose to use the annual influenza vaccine campaign in this mass exercise by setting the scenario as an emergence of a pandemic avian flu strain. To test this mass exercise, the Occupational Health Clinic partnered with the Department of Emergency Preparedness and Student Health. The goal was to vaccinate 8,000 faculty, staff, students, and volunteers in an 8-hour period. To accomplish this goal, the staff created excitement and fun to engage the participants. They did this by attempting to officially break the Guinness World Record--6,215 vaccines given in an 8-hour period. As a result of testing the university emergency preparedness pandemic plan, they more than doubled the world record by giving 12,850 vaccines in an 8-hour period. Most importantly, they successfully demonstrated that a real-life emergency mass immunization/prophylaxis administration could be executed seamlessly and efficiently.Examinations for employees are completed every 2 years. However, this examination does not include a hands-on assessment. Critical abnormal results are sent to the occupational health nurse in that facility, who then contacts employees within 2 weeks of the examinations. Examinations without critical results are reviewed with the employee, a total of 232 in 2010. The one-on-one sessions had several positive outcomes: employees were subsequently evaluated by their primary care providers, who potentially saved their lives, depending on the circumstances (e.g., evidence of myocardial damage, stents placed); employees were subsequently evaluated by their dentists, ophthalmologists, and other providers; employees registered for the fitness center; employees increased activity and changed eating habits; employees registered for a free nurse health coach to help them with a variety of behavior changes (e.g., smoking cessation, overeating, inactivity, or changes in their health status such as new-onset diabetes mellitus); and employees were referred to and contacted the Employee Assistance Program for assistance with stressors and mental health issues. In summary, employees feel special and take action after meeting with an occupational health nurse. They appreciated the one-on-one session and voiced this several times. At least 80% of the employees who met with the occupational health nurse to review the examination results stated they never met with the occupational health nurse prior to September 2010. Many were unaware of the covered annual wellness examination by their primary care provider, which includes visual and hands-on assessment.Recent research indicates that hearing loss among adolescents, ages 12 to 19, was greater in 2005 to 2006 than in 1988 to 1994. Therefore, it is likely that more young workers will have hearing deficits that put them at increased risk for occupational injuries. School nurses often screen students' hearing for their ability to hear teachers (e.g., up to 4000 Hz). School nurses not only care for students, but are often the occupational health nurses for staff and faculty exposed to hazardous noise (i.e., maintenance and cafeteria workers, and band and shop teachers). However, they lack the expertise of occupational health nurses related to prevention of noise-induced hearing loss. Occupational health nurses can provide valuable assistance to school nurses in championing hearing conservation in local schools. For example, occupational health nurses can promote collaboration between occupational and school nurse organizations for programs of mutual interest. Occupational health nurses can volunteer their services individually or supported by their employer to help develop hearing conservation programs for schools or initiate related health/science education using already available free or low-cost resources. A train-the-trainer course has been developed to introduce school nurses to hearing conservation in schools. It can be useful for occupational health nurses who are interested in collaborating with school nurses to receive approved continuing education contact hours being adapted to an online format that is available free, on-demand. This poster addressed school-related hearing conservation needs and how to access this course.FMCSA established the National Registry program to improve the screening of commercial motor vehicle (CMV) drivers and keep medically unqualified drivers off the road. This program will affect more than 4 million interstate drivers. More than 3 million examinations are expected to be conducted annually by at least 40,000 trained and certified examiners. This poster presentation provided a comprehensive overview of the National Registry program, including training, testing and administrative requirements, core curriculum topics, and driver and industry impact. Prior to the inception of the proposed National Registry, no training or testing requirement for health care professionals who conducted CMV driver physical examinations existed. After the compliance date for the final rule, FMCSA will only accept CMV driver certificates issued by certified examiners listed on the National Registry.Numerous barriers exist in obtaining agency approval to conduct evidence-based health outcomes research, particularly in corporate-based health care settings for which health care is not the major mission. Evidence-based health outcomes research in this setting will enable advanced practice nurses to demonstrate enhanced quality care and potentially an increased return on investment. However, conducting research depends on identifying all involved agency gatekeepers and navigating the associated layers of organizational administrative structures to successfully secure approval. Identification of all agency gatekeepers and simultaneous navigation of both academic and multilayered corporate approval processes was difficult in the case presented because the multifaceted process was complex, varied, and yet to be defined. Specific barriers encountered by a DNP (doctorate of nursing practice) student in defining and navigating this process were presented through case study and description of variations in this process among academic and non-academic settings were assessed. A model and time line titled ""Securing Support for Evidence-based Health Outcomes Research"" is proposed as a guide for the advanced practice nurse clinician or researcher to successfully navigate the process of securing academic and corporate gatekeeper approval to conduct evidence-based health outcomes research in the corporate health care setting. The model is based on Radosevich's Structured Guide for Implementing Health Outcomes Research in Clinical Settings and common themes from evidence-based practice frameworks identified in the literature. Investigation regarding use of the constructed model and associated time line in negotiating academic and corporate gatekeeper approval to conduct evidence-based health outcomes research in the corporate setting is ongoing.","https://www.proquest.com/docview/1023441001?accountid=44943&bdid=84593&_bd=CzbonCQkNgeWllepifVkb1C6F6E%3D","https://doi.org/10.3928/21650799-20120625-03"

However, conventional methods utilised for maritime risk assessment have been dominated by a few methodologies each of which have recognised weaknesses. Given the growing attention that supervised machine learning and big data applications for safety assessments have been receiving in other disciplines, a comprehensive review of the academic literature on this topic in the maritime domain has been conducted. The review encapsulates the prediction of accident occurrence, accident severity, ship detentions and ship collision risk. In particular, the purpose, methods, datasets and features of such studies are compared to better understand how such an approach can be applied in practice and its relative merits. Several key challenges within these themes are also identified, such as the availability and representativeness of the datasets and methodological challenges associated with transparency, model development and results evaluation. Whilst focused within the maritime domain, many of these findings are equally relevant to other transportation topics. This work, therefore, highlights both novel applications for applying these techniques to maritime safety and key challenges that warrant further research in order to strengthen this methodological approach.","https://www.proquest.com/docview/2746712764?accountid=44943&bdid=84593&_bd=cHXjqKRwYH3NdRHShJPTRSXXjqU%3D","https://doi.org/10.1080/01441647.2022.2036864"

Wave loads on rigid structures are divided into quasi static loads and impact loads. If the physics of quasi-static loads due to waves is well known, this cannot be said the same for wave impact loads. A comprehensive method to design maritime rigid structures under impact loads does not exist yet and the actual design method suggests avoiding scenarios where impact loads can take place. In the last decade, some laboratory experiments have been carried out; however some questions remain still unanswered. The use of different sensors can lead to significant changes in the results and an ""exhaustive comparison"" between dissimilar types of sensors has not been done yet. Even the magnitude of these forces can be underestimated during a laboratory test just for the choice of sample frequencies which are too low. This paper describes the experiments performed on a small scale flume at UPC on a scaled vertical breakwater in order to compare the results of pressure transducers and force load cells. Moreover, a high frequency sampler (up to 20 KHz) was used in order to understand the importance of sample frequency on the magnitude of the results.

IoV is used for communication among vehicles in real-time with their drivers, other vehicles, pedestrians, fleet management systems, and roadside infrastructure. High vehicular speeds and frequent network topology changes make vehicle communication extremely difficult on the IoV network. More constraints are imposed on IoV communication performance in a huge network environment due to the difficult road conditions and the enormous quantity of vehicles. A promising approach to improve the IoV communication performance is through vehicle clustering. Minimizing the number of clusters and identifying a reliable Cluster head (CH) are some of the most challenging tasks. In this paper, we propose a Swarm optimization-based and mobility-aware clustering method termed SOMACA. SOMACA consists of two phases clustering phase and the routing phase. During the clustering phase, we combine mobility measures and cluster distance to generate the minimum number of clusters having stable CHs and employ the Sparrow Search algorithm (SSA) for CH selection. The routing phase consists of two steps (1) Route Formation and (2) Route Upkeep. The main target for route formation step is to build a secure routing path between IoV nodes and base station (BS) by establishing an optimal list of links that are ordered from high to low, and in each round, it selects the best one. Moreover, the Upkeep step aims to update and maintain the existing connection. The performance of SOMACA is assessed using simulation experiments with various metrics including average cluster lifetime, transmission range, and network grid size. The simulation results show that SOMACA reduces the average number of clusters by [Formula Omitted], 22%,31%, 16%, and 43% less than CAVDO, GOA, GWOCNET, MFCA-IOV, MOGA-AWCP, HHOCNET, AMONE, and p-WOA algorithms respectively when the transmission ranges vary between 200 and 500.

Six refined BC sources were extracted from the factor analysis of aethalometer multi‐wavelength BC and concurrent observational datasets. In addition to the widely reported dominant sources, such as vehicular emissions (VE) and coal/biomass burning (BB), a discernible port and shipping emission source were identified with potential impacts on coastal air quality. The source‐specific BC showed abrupt changes in response to interventions (e.g., holidays) after separating weather‐related confounders. Significant reductions in deweathered coal and BB, VE, and local dust verified the effectiveness of policies, such as clean winter‐heating and support for the Clean Air Actions.

However, there are still many unsolved challenges while using federated learning in IoT-enabled MTS, such as the privacy preservation and Byzantine attacks. To surmount the above challenges, a novel mechanism, namely DisBezant, is designed to achieve the secure and Byzantine-robust federated learning in IoT-enabled MTS. Specifically, a credibility-based mechanism is proposed to resist the Byzantine attack in non-iid (not independent and identically distributed) dataset which is usually gathered from heterogeneous ships. The credibility is introduced to measure the trustworthiness of uploaded knowledge from ships and is updated based on their shared information in each epoch. Then, we design an efficient privacy-preserving gradient aggregation protocol based on a secure two-party calculation protocol. With the help of a central server, we can accurately recognise the Byzantine attackers and update the global model parameters privately. Furthermore, we theoretically discussed the privacy preservation and efficiency of DisBezant.

Then, the photographic information of each of these pigs is applied to a predictive model machine-learned in advance to determine whether or not there are candidate pigs for determining the presence or absence of abdominal fat-forming pigs. And if there is a candidate pig, it is determined using a machine-learning model for predicting whether the candidate pig is an abdominal fat-forming pig by analyzing the pattern of weight increase of the abdominal fat-forming pig and changes in weight of a candidate. If the candidate pig is an abdominal fat-forming pig, the timing of shipping is determined by predicting when the weight of the candidate pigs, specifically the abdominal fat-forming pigs, will reach a predetermined minimum shipping weight. This prediction is made using a machine-learning model that considers the weight gain trend pattern of abdominal fat-forming pigs and tracks changes in the weight of the candidate pig. A machine-learning model is used to predict the timing of weight gain in candidate pigs, specifically those that develop abdominal fat, in order to determine the optimal shipping time. By analyzing the weight gain patterns of abdominal fat-forming pigs and monitoring the weight changes in the candidate pig, the model can predict when the candidate pig will reach the minimum weight required for shipping.

To improve the energy efficiency of offloading transmission and workload computation, we focus on minimizing the total energy consumption by jointly optimizing the USVs’ offloaded workload, transmit power, computation resource allocation, as well as the UAV trajectory subject to the USVs’ latency requirements.

The method was realized in a near real time (NRT) application which allows for the processing of data from different satellites and modes. The algorithm estimates the total significant wave height Hₛ, dominant and secondary swell and windsea wave heights, first, and second moment wave periods, the mean wave period and the period of wind sea. The algorithm was applied to the Sentinel-1 (S1) C-band Interferometric Wide Swath Mode (IW), Extra Wide (EW) and Wave Mode (WV) Level-1 (L1) products and also extended to X-band TerraSAR-X (TS-X) StripMap (SM) products. The scenes are processed in raster and result in continuous sea state fields, with the exception of S1 WV, where averaged values for sea state parameters for along-orbit imagettes of 20 km × 20 km are presented. The developed empirical algorithm consists of two parts: a first CWAVE_EX (extended CWAVE) part, based on a linear regression approach, and a subsequent machine learning part using the support vector machine (SVM) technique. A series of new data preparation steps (i.e. filtering, denoising) and new features estimated from SAR images are also introduced. The algorithm was tuned and validated using two independent global wave model hindcasts, WaveWatch-3 and MFWAM as well as National Data Buoy Center (NDBC) measurements. The achieved root mean squared errors (RMSE) for CWAVE_EX for the total Hₛ are 0.60 m for low-resolution modes S1 IW (10 m pixel) and EW (40 m pixel) and 0.35 m for S1 WV and TS-X SM (pixel spacing ca.1–4 m) in comparison to model predictions. The RMSEs of the retrieved wave periods are in the range of 0.45–0.90 s for all of the satellites and models considered. Similarly, the dominant and secondary swell, and wind sea wave height RMSEs are in the range of 0.35–0.80 m. The SVM postprocessing improves the accuracy of the initial results of CWAVE_EX for Hₛ and reaches an RMSE of 0.25 m for S1 WV. Comparisons to 64 NDBC buoys, collocated at distances shorter than 50 km to S1 WV imagettes worldwide, result in an RMSE of 0.41 m. All results and the methods presented are novel in terms of the accuracy achieved, combining the classical approach with machine learning techniques, and performing an automatic NRT processing of multiparametric sea state fields from L1 data with automatic switching for different satellites and modes. The complete archive of S1 WV L1 Single Look Complex products from December 2014 until February 2021 was processed to create a sea state parameter database and validated using model hindcast and buoy measurements. The derived parameters are available to the public within the scope of the European Space Agency's Climate Change Initiative.","https://www.proquest.com/docview/2718336287?accountid=44943&bdid=84593&_bd=4gN%2BHEahS1%2B0GuvV5Ll9dQBWAOk%3D","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.rse.2022.113200"

Since road congestion has a big impact on driving times, fleet management can be enhanced by taking into account data on current traffic conditions. Today, most carriers gather high-quality historical traffic data by using global position system information. These data serve as an input for defining time-dependent travel times, i.e. travel times changing according to traffic conditions throughout the day. Given a fixed-size fleet of vehicles and a graph with arc traversal times varying over time, Time-Dependent Vehicle Routing Problems aim to select the best routes while minimizing the travelling costs. The basic version with only one route is usually referred to as the Time-Dependent Travelling Salesman Problem. The main goal of this work is to define tight upper bounds for this problem by reusing the information gained when solving instances with similar features. This is customary in distribution management, where vehicle routes have to be generated over and over again with similar input data. To this aim, the authors devise an upper bounding technique based on the solution of a classical (and simpler) time-independent Asymmetric Travelling Salesman Problem, where the constant arc costs are suitably defined by the combined use of a Linear Program and a mix of unsupervised and supervised Machine Learning techniques. The effectiveness of this approach has been assessed through a computational campaign on the real travel time functions of two European cities: Paris and London. The overall average gap between the proposed heuristic and the best-known solutions is about 0.001%. For 31 instances, new best solutions have been obtained.","https://www.proquest.com/docview/2763813997?accountid=44943&bdid=84593&_bd=jWfFfZdDOnGS6ep4fVByMef5lCQ%3D","https://doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2022.3233852"

As a result of this catastrophic event, hundreds of individuals have become homeless. In addition, rescuers are not usually effective enough to rescue the majority of victims. This is due to inadequate rescue operations infrastructure, a severe flaw in today’s technologically advanced society. This manuscript proposes a microservice-dependent secure rescue framework that uses geographic information system mapping with a K-Means clustering algorithm to identify flood-prone regions. Numerous microservices, such as fleet management, cloud computing, and data security, integrate and execute the framework in pre- and post-flood situations. Labeling data from the proposed framework generates a support vector machine-based classifier for predicting flood risk. Furthermore, a hybrid A* algorithm is developed to find an optimal route for the rescue operation. Based on the K-means clustering results, which reduced the variance by 89.2 percent overall, dividing the data into six clusters was the best option for this study.

Improving the water level prediction accuracy of large cascade hydropower stations is significant for flood control, shipping, irrigation, etc. A new hybrid model based on a refined deep residual shrinkage network and an optimized gated recurrent unit – long term memory network (GRU-LSTM) model is proposed for water level prediction at different time scales. First, to make the input data in the form of a feature map so the model can capture the weight characteristics of each influencing factor when the water level changes, the water level, flow rate, and hydroelectric power plant output data are constructed as high-dimensional feature inputs. To reduce the prediction error caused by downstream tributary backwater jacking, downstream tributary flow is added to the input data. At the same time, a semisoft threshold function with an adjustable function is inserted into the model to improve feature recognition accuracy, reduce deviation, and eliminate the noise of the original hydrological data. Second, an error weight correction function is used to adjust the error between the predicted water level and the observed water level so that the model can automatically adjust the weights of each influencing factor according to the evaluation results of water level prediction. In this process, the parameters of LSTM are optimized using the Archimedes optimization algorithm, and the output results of the LSTM and GRU networks are weighted to obtain a more accurate water level prediction. The proposed model achieves good accuracy and efficiency in downstream water level prediction of the Xiangjiaba Hydropower Station, outperforms existing hydrodynamic and artificial intelligence methods, and has robust scalability in flood forecasting and urban rainwater forecasting.","https://www.proquest.com/docview/2834209603?accountid=44943&bdid=84593&_bd=%2B6ENq%2BlpiniBH2VUXk5JLVwXZ28%3D","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jhydrol.2022.129044"

A known challenge in the maritime industry is communication between ship owner management onshore and the crew on board a ship, especially during incident handling. To mitigate this issue and enhance cooperation in the digital age, crew and ship owner management need to meet, train for, and discuss cyber risks and their challenges. One way to enhance cohesive teams and effective communication is through the application of a human-centred design (HCD) approach to holistic team training. This paper proposes how simulator instructors should utilise HCD for the development of maritime cyber resilience training, tailored to a variety of maritime stakeholders including ship’s crew and onshore support personnel. To do this, this paper will explore relevant learning theories and current maritime and cyber-related training methods. The paper will then demonstrate, through a practical application, the effectiveness of adopting HCD when designing maritime cyber resilience training. This application will argue that maritime simulators present an effective training solution for new cyber-related incidents. The authors demonstrate the application of HCD by showcasing a ballast water handling system cyber incident designed for the simulator.

It is, however, challenging to assess how the implementation of these systems affects the safety of ship operation. We propose to utilize marine training simulators to conduct controlled, repeated experiments allowing us to compare and assess how functionality for autonomous navigation and decision support affects navigation performance and safety. However, although marine training simulators are realistic to human navigators, it cannot be assumed that the simulators are sufficiently realistic for testing the object detection and classification functionality, and hence this functionality cannot be directly implemented in the simulators. We propose to overcome this challenge by utilizing Cycle-Consistent Adversarial Networks (Cycle-GANs) to transform the simulator data before object detection and classification is performed. Once object detection and classification are completed, the result is transferred back to the simulator environment. Based on this result, decision support functionality with realistic accuracy and robustness can be presented and autonomous ships can make decisions and navigate in the simulator environment.","https://www.proquest.com/docview/2793657668?accountid=44943&bdid=84593&_bd=rd9QSFck4DKE4qv0JWw7vVLV0Hk%3D","https://doi.org/10.1177/1748006X211021040"

The hyper-parameters of these two DT algorithms are optimized using two state-of-the-art optimization algorithms, namely random search (RS) and Bayesian optimization (BO), respectively, aiming to obtain the prediction model with the highest accuracy. Experimental results reveal that BO-RF algorithm produces the best accuracy as compared to others.

Vision sensors have recently received considerable attention and are being developed as AI advances, leading to various container motion detection methods. Faster-RCNN is a detection method that performs better precision and recall than other methods. Nonetheless, the detectors are set using the Faster-RCNN default parameters. It is of interest to optimized its parameters for producing more accurate detectors for container detection tasks. Faster RCNN requires mixed integer optimization for its continuous and integer parameters. Efficient Modified Particle Swarm Optimization (EMPSO) offers a method to optimize integer parameter by evolutionary updating the space of each candidate solution but has high possibility stuck in the local minima due to rapid growth of Gbest and Pbest space. This paper proposes two modifications to improve EMPSO that could adapt to the current global solution. Firstly, the non-Gbest and Pbest total position spaces are made adaptive to changes according to the Gbest and Pbest position spaces. Second, a weighted multiobjective optimization for Faster-RCNN is proposed based on minimum loss, average loss, and gradient of loss to give priority scale. The integer EMPSO with adaptive changes to Gbest and Pbest position space is first tested on nine non-linear standard test functions to validate its performance, the results show performance improvement in finding global minimum compared to EMPSO. This tested algorithm is then applied to optimize Faster-RCNN with the weighted cost function, which uses 1300 container images to train the model and then tested on four videos of moving containers at seaports. The results produce better performances regarding the speed and achieving the optimal solution. This technique causes better minimum losses, average losses, intersection over union, confidence score, precision, and accuracy than the results of the default parameters.","https://www.proquest.com/docview/2780767084?accountid=44943&bdid=84593&_bd=oFkBFU9%2FQ0Q5RG1Rh%2FB8H9gMyc0%3D","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.heliyon.2023.e13213"

In the age of big data, when applications run around a huge volume, to transfer data from the data side to the computation side to co-allocate the data and code, leads to high latency. All existing serverless architectures are based on the data shipping architecture. In this paper, we present an inter-region code shipping architecture for serverless, that enables the code to flow from computation side to the data side where the size of the code is negligible compared to the data size. We tested our proposed architecture over a real-time cloud platform Amazon Web Services with the integration of the Fission serverless tool. The evaluation of the proposed code shipping architecture shows for a data file size of 64 MB, the latency in the proposed code shipping architecture is 8.36 ms and in existing data shipped architecture is found to be 16.8 ms. Hence, the proposed architecture achieves a speedup of 2x on the round latency for high data sizes in a serverless environment. We define round latency to be the duration to read and write back the data in the storage.","https://www.proquest.com/docview/2814910211?accountid=44943&bdid=84593&_bd=2XXVKuUhthZJaS68fX3y%2FTOMREM%3D","https://doi.org/10.1007/s11227-023-05104-7"

Yet UMVs are considered essential for safer, more efficient, and more effective maritime futures. There is a fundamental challenge facing industry and regulators about how to develop and support the nascent UMV industry while maintaining the safety and risk management principles and processes in legacy laws and regulations predicated on the conventional crewed vessel. This paper, drawing upon case studies of developer and operator experiences with Australia’s maritime safety framework, argues for an “intent-based”, flexible, and collaborative approach based on developers’ and operators’ experiences. The case studies show that ad hoc and bespoke regulatory pathways, utilising exemptions and discretions under Australian national laws, although problematic in terms of regulatory consistency and capacity to deal with scale, did allow for the trialling and deployment of two small UMVs. More importantly, the ad hoc approach facilitated information exchange between industry and regulators that is generating reforms and changes at the national level. Although focused on Australia, the findings are significant for maritime futures. It reveals a dialectical approach whereby maritime nations pragmatically work through the risks, standards, and processes that balance safety with facilitating local UMV industries, and in turn, this creates a body of knowledge to inform international reform processes. It also shows the importance of documenting and reflecting on the regulatory journeys of UMV pioneers as essential for safer, more efficient, and effective maritime industries that leverage the potential benefits of automation.","https://www.proquest.com/docview/2864955825?accountid=44943&bdid=84593&_bd=Ag0Epd2fiT84Y0OzjL1takJ0jrg%3D","https://doi.org/10.1007/s13437-022-00295-x"

The applications of ubiquitous IoTs have been extended to Maritime Transportation Systems (MTS) that spawned increasing security threats; posing serious fiscal concerns to stakeholders involved. Among these threats, Distributed Denial of Service Attack (DDoS) is ranked very high that can wreak havoc on IoT artifacts of the MTS networks. Timely and effective detection of such attacks is imperative for necessary mitigation. Conventional approaches exploit entropy of attributes in network traffic for detecting DDoS attacks. However, the majority of these approaches are static in nature and consider only a few network traffic parameters, limiting the number of DDoS attack detection to a few types and intensities. In current research, a novel framework named “Dual Stack Machine Learning (S2ML)” has been proposed to calculate distinct entropy-based varying 10-Tuple (T) features from network traffic features, three window sizes and associated Rate of Exponent Separation (RES). These features have been exploited for developing an intelligent model over MTS-IoT datasets to successfully detect multiple types of DDoS attacks in MTS. S2ML is an efficient framework that overcomes the shortcomings of prevalent DDoS detection approaches, as evident from the comparison with Multi-layer Perceptron (MLP), Alternating Decision Tree (ADT) and Simple Logistic Regression (SLR) over different evaluation metrics (Confusion metrics, ROCs). The proposed S2ML technique outperforms prevalent ones with 1.5% better results compared to asserted approaches on distribution of normal/attack traffic.

Even though, the large latency and energy consumption brought by some high-definition image-processing task still make some visual tracking difficult to perform. We first investigate the impact of video frame resolution on computing task size and detection accuracy, and further on task latency and energy consumption.

We model the UAVs tracking system as an energy consumption optimization problem with the constraint of task latency. Although the proposed optimization problem is complex, we transform the optimization problem into several subproblems with decoupling and rigorous mathematical proof.

Remotely sensed data and spatial modeling enable mapping of tree species presence and distribution. Following an assessment of tree species identified in the sample-based National Forest Inventory (NFI), we mapped 37 tree species over the 650-Mha, forest-dominated ecosystems of Canada representing 2019 conditions. Landsat imagery and related spectral indices, geographic and climate data, elevation derivatives, and remote sensing-derived phenology are used as predictor variables trained with calibration samples from Canada's NFI using the Random Forests machine learning algorithm. Based upon prior knowledge of tree species distributions, classification models were implemented on a regional basis, meaning only the tree species that are expected in a given mapping region were modeled using local calibration samples. Modeling resulted in class membership probabilities values for each regionally eligible tree species for all treed pixels as well as an indicator of attribution confidence derived from the distance in feature space between the two leading classes. Accuracy assessment was conducted using independent validation data also drawn from the NFI following the same selection rules and indicated an overall accuracy of 93.1% ± 0.1% (95%-confidence interval). Predictor variables informing on geographic, climatic and topographic conditions had the largest importance on the classification models. Nationally, the most common leading tree species were black spruce (Picea mariana; 203 Mha or 57.3% of the treed area), trembling aspen (Populus tremuloides; 34.7 Mha, 9.8%), and lodgepole pine (Pinus contorta; 21.1 Mha, 5.9%). Regionally, there was ecozone-level dominance of other tree species, including subalpine fir (Abies lasiocarpa; Montane Cordillera), western hemlock (Tsuga heterophylla; Pacific Maritime), and balsam fir (Abies balsamea; Atlantic Maritime). Based upon the per-pixel class membership probabilities, species assemblages akin to those in forest inventories can also be produced. Further, given the calibrated reflectance of Landsat imagery, the methods presented herein can be implemented over a time series of images. The approach uses open data as predictor variables, making the method portable to other areas given availability of tree species training data.","https://www.proquest.com/docview/2723125578?accountid=44943&bdid=84593&_bd=yVC254U5qz%2FRaUpzmhAWy7TBksE%3D","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.rse.2022.113276"

Real-time power management of multiple power sources in both design and operation becomes critical due to the uncertainty and randomness of the vessel's power demand. Furthermore, the vessel operators may have additional requirements for operational flexibility, such as fully recharging the battery before the next trip and limiting engine switch on/off to reduce wear-and-tear, which lead to complex power management systems requiring domain-expert knowledge. In this article, a hybrid solution for real-time power management is proposed. The model-based approach encapsulates the power system, and the data-driven approach (a machine learning technique called Markov approximation) handles the uncertainty. First, an offline deterministic optimization problem for power management is formulated. Second, the deterministic problem is transformed into a maximum weighted independent set (MWIS) problem. Next, the Markov approximation framework is applied to the transformed problem to utilize the machine learning techniques widely used in wireless communications and computing industries. Finally, a reinforcement learning-based real-time solution is proposed. Extensive simulations are performed on a ferry case study, and the results are within the proven theoretical bounds of machine learning techniques.","https://www.proquest.com/docview/2853023301?accountid=44943&bdid=84593&_bd=nn45RU4bJwGntvD10nRJ1qx%2FpTo%3D","https://doi.org/10.1109/TPWRS.2022.3215153"

The port state control officer (PSCO) routing problem involves selecting ships for inspection and determining the inspection sequence for available PSCOs, aiming to identify the highest number of deficiencies. Port authorities face this problem daily, making decisions without prior knowledge of ship conditions. Traditionally, a predict-then-optimize framework is employed, but its machine learning (ML) models' loss function fails to account for the impact of predictions on the downstream optimization problem, potentially resulting in suboptimal decisions. We adopt a decision-focused learning framework, integrating the PSCO routing problem into the ML models' training process. However, as the PSCO routing problem is NP-hard and plugging it into the training process of ML models requires that it be solved numerous times, computational complexity and scalability present significant challenges. To address these issues, we first convert the PSCO routing problem into a compact model using undominated inspection templates, enhancing the model's solution efficiency. Next, we employ a family of surrogate loss functions based on noise-contrastive estimation (NCE) for the ML model, requiring a solution pool treating suboptimal solutions as noise samples. This pool represents a convex hull of feasible solutions, avoiding frequent reoptimizations during the ML model's training process. Through computational experiments, we compare the predictive and prescriptive qualities of both the two-stage framework and the decision-focused learning framework under varying instance sizes. Our findings suggest that accurate predictions do not guarantee good decisions; the decision-focused learning framework's performance may depend on the optimization problem size and the training dataset size; and using a solution pool containing noise samples strikes a balance between training efficiency and decision performance.","https://www.proquest.com/docview/2887616083?accountid=44943&bdid=84593&_bd=%2B%2F0JuwXKCS96obpJBoINhcLTPLk%3D","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ocecoaman.2023.106695"

In this article, we propose a hybrid low-Earth orbit (LEO) and unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) edge computing method in space–air–sea integrated networks for marine IoT systems. Specifically, two types of edge servers mounted on UAVs and LEO satellites are endowed with computational capabilities for the real-time utilization of a sizable data collected from ocean IoT sensors. Our system aims at minimizing the total energy consumption of the battery-constrained UAV by jointly optimizing the bit allocation of communication and computation along with the UAV path planning under latency, energy budget, and operational constraints. For availability and practicality, the proposed methods are developed for three different cases according to the accessibility of the LEO satellite, “Always On,” “Always Off,” and “Intermediate Disconnected,” by leveraging successive convex approximation (SCA) strategies. Via numerical results, we verify that significant energy savings can be accrued for all cases of LEO accessibility by means of joint optimization of bit allocation and UAV path planning compared to partial optimization schemes that design for only the bit allocation or trajectory of the UAV.","https://www.proquest.com/docview/2892375363?accountid=44943&bdid=84593&_bd=JsBlnN%2FT65rQxvjeOKMk3F6hiso%3D","https://doi.org/10.1109/JIOT.2023.3287196"

Additionally, the international shipping prices soared first, but the international shipping price have then fluctuated back from the high, and gradually entered a reasonable range. Faced with these fluctuating situations and fierce competition, liners have been leveraging big data analysis technology to predict and share demand information to maintain a resilient transportation system. Targeting a duopoly market structure, this study considers the price and product quality competition environment and studies liners' prediction and sharing strategies of demand information. By establishing a game model to compare three scenarios, namely no demand information prediction, unilateral demand information prediction without sharing, and unilateral demand information prediction and sharing, this study analyzes the impacts of important factors such as market competition intensity and information accuracy on the expected returns of liners and consumer surplus. The research shows that: (1) Whether a liner company invests in predicting the demand information depends on the accuracy of the demand prediction information. When the accuracy of demand prediction information is high enough, liners invest in demand information prediction, resulting in a “win-win” situation in the maritime market. (2) Liners' sharing of demand prediction information reduces the intensity of maritime market competition, which leads to a “satisfactory win-win” situation where the expected returns of both parties increase, with the party sharing the demand information enjoying a greater increase.

Nevertheless, along with important advantages, a number of challenges associated with the development and deployment of unmanned ships were identified, including technological challenges, regulatory challenges, safety and security challenges, and technology investment challenges. All these challenges have to be adequately addressed by the relevant stakeholders to ensure the successful deployment of unmanned ships around the globe in the following years.","https://www.proquest.com/docview/2803963022?accountid=44943&bdid=84593&_bd=lAfBZJLhICvFVnaBamzLki3cpAs%3D","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.heliyon.2023.e15182"
"A machine learning method for the evaluation of ship grounding risk in real operational conditions","","Zhang, Mingyang; Kujala, Pentti; Hirdaris, Spyros","Reliability Engineering & System Safety","Scholarly Journals","","226","","2022-10-01","Oct 2022","1","","","0951-8320","","","ENG","Ship groundings may often lead to damages resulting in oil spills or ship flooding and subsequent capsizing. Risks can be estimated qualitatively through experts' judgment or quantitatively through the analysis of maritime traffic data. Yet, studies using big data remain limited. In this paper, we present a big data analytics method for the evaluation of grounding risk in real environmental conditions. The method makes use of big data streams from the Automatic Identification System (AIS), nowcast data, and the seafloor depth data from the General Bathymetric Chart of the Oceans (GEBCO). The evasive action of Ro-Pax passenger ships operating in shallow waters is idealized under various traffic patterns that link to side - or forward - grounding scenarios. Consequently, an Avoidance Behaviour-based Grounding Detection Model (ABGD-M) is introduced to identify potential grounding scenarios, and the grounding probabilistic risk is quantified at observation points along ship routes in various voyages. The method is applied on a Ro-Pax ship operating over 2.5 years ice-free period in the Gulf of Finland. Results indicate that grounding probabilistic risk estimation may be extremely diverse and depends on voyage routes, observation points, and operational conditions. It is concluded that the proposed method may assist with (1) better identification of critical grounding scenarios that are underestimated in existing accident databases; (2) improved understanding of grounding avoidance behaviours in real operational conditions; (3) the estimation of grounding probabilistic risk profile over the life cycle of fleet operations and (4) better evaluation of waterway complexity indices and ship operational vulnerability.","https://www.proquest.com/docview/2709093195?accountid=44943&bdid=84593&_bd=dUg44uflS3ExfU8HDTCuWexIJw0%3D","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ress.2022.108697"

Traditional methods are weak in migration capabilities and cumbersome in manual design. Existing deep learning-based methods can achieve high recognition and detection accuracy, but most of them have a very large number of parameters and slow recognition and computational efficiency, which makes it difficult for them to migrate to edge computing equipments, and computational efficiency is crucial in rapid maritime rescue and emergency military deployment. Therefore, we propose a lightweight feature extraction block, lightweight split concat block (LSCB), for SAR automatic target recognition and detection. Specifically, LSCB consists of several operators, such as split, depthwise convolution (DC), multiple kernel sizes block (MKSB), and channel-shuffle (CS). MKSB is a novel channel attention mechanism designed by us, which can make feature maps have target features of different scales and adjust their receptive field sizes adaptively. In addition, to assess the performance of LSCB, we use LSCB to build LSCNet-R and LSCNet-D for SAR target recognition and detection, respectively, and conduct extensive experiments on MSTAR, SSDD, and SAR-Ship-Dataset. The experimental results show that our LSCNet-R and LSCNet-D built with LSCB achieve higher recognition and detection accuracy and computational efficiency with few parameters compared with existing excellent methods.

In the novel scheme, the constant attributes of a maritime terminal are utilized to generate its certification. In addition, on-board sensors are introduced in the system to help aggregate the status and surrounding environment of the maritime terminal.

The monitoring of indirect quality measurement variables associated with the application of machine-learning (ML) models satisfactorily predicted the physical quality of the grain mass, over the shipping time, for the different conditions tested. The moisture content associated with time was the factor with the greatest influence on the quality of transported grains. The shipping time is the determining factor for controlling the quality of grains. Lots of soybeans harvested from crops with moisture content between 14% and 18% must not exceed 120 min of shipping time to maintain quality. It is recommended that the shipping time of grains shipped from storage units to processing industries, with moisture contents between 11% and 14%, should not exceed 840 min.

The aims of this study were: (1) to model Maritime pine potential distributions for the present and for the future under two climate change scenarios using the machine learning Maximum Entropy algorithm (MaxEnt); (2) to update the species ecological envelope maps using the same environmental data set and climate change scenarios; and (3) to perform an agreement analysis for the species distribution maps produced with both methodological approaches. The species distribution maps produced by each of the methodological approaches under study were reclassified into presence–absence binary maps of species to perform the agreement analysis. The results showed that the MaxEnt-predicted map for the present matched well the species’ current distribution, but the species ecological envelope map, also for the present, was closer to the species’ empiric potential distribution. Climate change impacts on the species’ future distributions maps using the MaxEnt were moderate, but areas were relocated. The 47.3% suitability area (regular-medium-high), in the present, increased in future climate change scenarios to 48.7%–48.3%. Conversely, the impacts in species ecological envelopes maps were higher and with greater future losses than the latter. The 76.5% suitability area (regular-favourable-optimum), in the present, decreased in future climate change scenarios to 58.2%–51.6%. The two approaches combination resulted in a 44% concordance for the species occupancy in the present, decreasing around 30%–35% in the future under the climate change scenarios. Both methodologies proved to be complementary to set species’ best suitability areas, which are key as support decision tools for planning afforestation and forest management to attain fire-resilient landscapes, enhanced forest ecosystems biodiversity, functionality and productivity.","https://www.proquest.com/docview/2887993873?accountid=44943&bdid=84593&_bd=XDg9mNTUFGoWil7plca289PiCro%3D","https://doi.org/10.3390/f14030591"

This method is applied to comprehensively assess the safety of an autonomous inland waterways ship at a preliminary design phase. The hazardous scenarios are identified and ranked by a number of experts participating in a series of sessions. The identified hazards risk is estimated considering the frequency and severity indices, whereas their uncertainty is estimated by employing the standard deviations in these two indices among the experts ranking results. Epistemic uncertainty is also considered during ranking. Risk control measures are proposed to de-risk the critical hazards.

Our method involved interviewing technology designers (n = 9) and navigators aboard two partially automated ferries (n = 5), as well as collecting field observations aboard one of the ferries. The results indicated a discrepancy between how designers construed human-AI collaboration compared to navigators' own accounts in the field. Navigators reflected upon their role as one of 'backup,' defined by ad-hoc control takeovers from the automation. Designers positioned navigators 'in the loop' of a larger control system but discounted the role of in-situ skills and heuristic decision making in all but the most controlled takeover actions. The discrepancy shed light on how integration of AI systems may be better aligned to human cooperation in navigation. This included designing AI systems that render computational activities more visible and that incorporate social cues that articulate human work in its natural setting.

However, most of the methods based on deep learning train their models in a centralized manner, which needs uploading all data to the central server for training, increasing the risk of privacy disclosure. In this paper, we consider the characteristics of IoT-based MTS and propose a CNN-MLP based model for intrusion detection which is trained through Federated Learning, named FedBatch. Federated Learning keeps the model training local and only updates the global model through the exchange of model parameters, preserving the privacy of local data on vessels. First, the characteristics of the communication between different vessels are discussed to model the federated learning process during the voyage. Then, the lightweight local model constructed by Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and Multi-Layer Perception (MLP) is designed to save on computing and storage overhead. Moreover, to mitigate the straggler problem during the federated learning in MTS, we proposed an adaptive aggregation method, named Batch Federated Aggregation, which suppresses the oscillations of model parameters during federated learning.

Thus, there is a pressing need for accurate soil data for the Antarctic ice-free areas, especially under the pressures imposed by climate changes and human disturbances on the continent. In this work, we predicted the distribution of sand, silt, and clay of the main ice-free areas of Maritime Antarctica and Northern Antarctic Peninsula, allowing novel soil texture maps to be produced for Antarctica. We used legacy soil texture data and tested different machine learning models, of which Random Forest presented the best performance to prediction. The best predictors were associated with climate, topography, and soil development degree, representing the scorpan model factors. The highest accuracy was obtained for clay prediction, mainly in the topsoil (LCCC of 0.49 and R² of 0.31). In the mapping, the sand contents presented higher values, with a predominance of sandy loam texture, although clay contents are higher in some spots where chemical weathering is stronger. The final maps presented good spatial consistency, with soil texture distributed according to factors such as geomorphology, parent material and pedogenetic development.

While intelligent maritime transportation systems bring convenience to the maritime industry, ship operation and management are also confronted with network risks. The Internet of Things (IoT) installed in the shipborne network collects and monitors the environmental data of the whole ship. It uses the collected data to make decisions to control the ship. The threat of Local Area Network (LAN) of IoT in ships has become an emerging issue. The DNS rebinding attack is a typical attack, which can bypass firewalls and seriously threaten the marine network in security and privacy of the local IoT. DNS rebinding attacks are difficult to model and detect, due to their sophisticated characteristics. In this work, we define threat models of DNS rebinding attacks and propose an effective method for the detection of and the defense against these attacks. First, we define threat models for DNS rebinding attacks. We employ a Markov chain to model the process of DNS rebinding attacks. With the threat modeling, the attack behaviors are clearly characterized and the most relevant attributes are thus extracted. Second, we propose an effective method for the detection of DNS rebinding attacks in the marine transportation system. The detection method includes the initialization method and the verification method, which manages and verifies access permission of equipment information and the service interface of the IoT in the shipborn network. Finally, we simulate the DNS rebinding attacks on the marine IoT. We analyze and test the security and the performance of the initialization method and the verification method in the simulated environment. The extensive experimental results demonstrate that the IoT in marine networks is vulnerable to DNS rebinding.

Specifically, a variational autoencoder is used to discover the potential connections between each dimension of the normal trajectory, while a graph variational autoencoder is used to explore the spatial similarity between normal trajectories. Based on internal connection of trajectories, a deep reinforcement learning algorithm, Twin Delayed Deep Deterministic policy gradient (TD3), is employed to train the trajectory anomaly detection model. To reduce the model training time, transfer learning is used to migrate the trained anomaly detection model between different regions of an ocean area or between similar ocean areas. Moreover, an efficient data transformation module is designed to improve the efficiency of model transfer.

To guarantee the transmission security of confidential data, an important alternative in an untrustworthy IoT-enabled MTS is to apply the covert timing channels. This paper mainly introduces the construction of covert timing channel with low bit shifting rate and high reliability by multi-stage verification and error correction. For the covert timing channel schemes realized by active packet loss, the packet loss noise interferes with the channel’s reliability. However, due to the constraints of stealthiness, the active packet loss ratio during covert communication is low, so more effective reliable strategies are needed to reduce noise interference. In the excellent scenario, when the bit error rate is lower than 0.08%, the transmission performance is kept at 0.49 bps. In the good scenario with strong network noise, although this method loses some performance, it can still maintain the transmission performance of 0.2 bps under the condition of bit error rate less than 1%, which effectively proves the effectiveness of multi-stage verification and error correction.","https://www.proquest.com/docview/2774334052?accountid=44943&bdid=84593&_bd=mHbBQ5lmjn%2B41Lem8KaPg3540BU%3D","https://doi.org/10.1109/TITS.2021.3118853"

In the considered multi-UAV maritime IoT system, the UAVs act as the aerial base stations to complete the missions of data collection from buoys and data offloading to the offshore base station (OBS). In this case, the UAVs need to adaptively select the mission mode between data collection and data offloading according to the network resources and mission requirements. In this paper, we aimed to minimize the completion time of data collection and offloading missions for all UAVs by jointly optimizing the UAV trajectories, mission mode selection, transmit power of buoys, and association relationships between the UAVs and buoy/OBS. In order to solve the mixed-integer non-convex minimization problem, we first designed a multi-agent deep reinforcement learning algorithm based on a hybrid discrete and continuous action space to preliminarily obtain the UAV trajectories, mission mode selection, and the transmit power of buoys. Then, we propose an algorithm based on the stable marriage problem to determine the buoy–UAV and UAV–OBS association relationships. Finally, the simulation results show that the proposed algorithms can effectively shorten the total mission completion time of data collection and offloading for the multi-UAV-assisted maritime IoT system.","https://www.proquest.com/docview/3040465687?accountid=44943&bdid=84593&_bd=kJqUOo0O7MDa0Oi60uYWrjbSPyM%3D","https://doi.org/10.3390/rs15020292"

To detect such occurrences with supervised learning methods the AIS messages must be manually annotated, which can be a demanding process. Therefore, unsupervised methods are used to identify anomalous traffic patterns based on vessel trajectories. Typically, dense regions of maritime activity are studied to capture common traffic patterns which help identify trajectories that do not follow the norm. However, these approaches cannot detect anomalous behaviors along common pathways or incorporate time-related events into the analysis. Such challenges motivate the approach taken in this work by using auto-regressive techniques to model vessel trajectories and clustering analyses to explore behavior patterns of vessels.

Meanwhile, the IoT devices are resource-constrained and cannot implement the existing security systems, making them susceptible to various types of debilitating cyber-attacks. The dynamics in the attack processes in IoT-enabled MTS networks keep changing, which makes a traditional offline or batch ML-based attack detection systems intractable to apply. This paper provides a novel approach of using an adaptive incremental passive-aggressive machine learning (AI-PAML) method to create a network attack detection system (NADS) to protect the IoT devices in an MTS environment. In this paper, we propose an NADS that utilizes a multi-access edge computing (MEC) platform to provide computational resources to execute the proposed model at a network end. Since online learning models face data saturation problems, we present an improved approximate linear dependence and a modified hybrid forgetting mechanism to filter the inefficient data and keep the detection model up-to-date. The proposed data filtering ensures that the model does not experience a rapid increase in unwarranted data, which affects the model’s attack detection rate. A Markov transition probability is applied to control the MEC selection and data offloading process by the IoT devices. The performance of the NADS is verified using selected benchmark datasets and a realistic IoT environment. Experimental results demonstrate that AI-PAML achieves remarkable performance in the NADS design for an MTS environment.","https://www.proquest.com/docview/2774334202?accountid=44943&bdid=84593&_bd=XWfXldfmJrz0Kuvu514KKwIJKMs%3D","https://doi.org/10.1109/TITS.2022.3159450"

However, this means the sea lanes are becoming more and more crowded, leading to high probabilities of marine accidents in complex maritime environments. According to relevant historical statistics, a large number of accidents have happened in water areas that lack high precision navigation data, which can be utilized to enhance navigation safety. The purpose of this work was to carry out ship route planning automatically, by mining historical big automatic identification system (AIS) data. It is well-known that experiential navigation information hidden in maritime big data could be automatically extracted using advanced data mining techniques; assisting in the generation of safe and reliable ship planning routes for complex maritime environments. In this paper, a novel method is proposed to construct a big data-driven framework for generating ship planning routes automatically, under varying navigation conditions. The method performs density-based spatial clustering of applications with noise first on a large number of ship trajectories to form different trajectory vector clusters. Then, it iteratively calculates its centerline in the trajectory vector cluster, and constructs the waterway network from the node-arc topology relationship among these centerlines. The generation of shipping route could be based on the waterway network and conducted by rasterizing the marine environment risks for the sea area not covered by the waterway network. Numerous experiments have been conducted on different AIS data sets in different water areas, and the experimental results have demonstrated the effectiveness of the framework of the ship route planning proposed in this paper.","https://www.proquest.com/docview/2438702597?accountid=44943&bdid=84593&_bd=mvrGvqvNit%2FRq7F%2FuADUZQ9VzWc%3D","https://doi.org/10.1007/s13131-020-1638-5"

Due to the increase in the marine transportation and shipping industry, oil spills have increased in recent years. Moreover, the rapid spread of oil spills in open waters seriously affects the fragile marine ecosystem and creates environmental concerns. Effective monitoring, quick identification, and estimation of the volume of oil spills are the first and most crucial steps for a successful cleanup operation and crisis management. Remote Sensing observations, especially from Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) sensors, are a very suitable choice for this purpose due to their ability to collect data regardless of the weather and illumination conditions and over far and large areas of the Earth. Owing to the relatively complex nature of SAR observations, machine learning (ML) based algorithms play an important role in accurately detecting and monitoring oil spills and can significantly help experts in faster and more accurate detection. This paper uses SAR images from ESA's Copernicus Sentinel-1 satellite to detect and locate oil spills in open waters under different environmental conditions. To this end, a deep learning framework has been presented to identify oil spills automatically. The SAR images were segmented into two classes, the oil slick and the background, using convolutional neural networks (CNN) and vision transformers (ViT). Various scenarios for the proposed architecture were designed by placing ViT networks in different parts of the CNN backbone. An extensive dataset of oil spill events in various regions across the globe was used to train and assess the performance of the proposed framework. After the detection performance assessments, the F1-score values for the standard DeepLabV3+, FC-DenseNet, and U-Net networks were 75.08 %, 73.94 %, and 60.85, respectively. In the combined networks models (combination of CNN and ViT), the best F1-score results were obtained as 78.48 %. Our results showed that these hybrid models could improve detection accuracy and have a high ability to distinguish oil spill borders even in noisy images. Evaluation metrics are increased in all the combined networks compared to the original CNN networks.","https://www.proquest.com/docview/2834204019?accountid=44943&bdid=84593&_bd=lMQd5H42itWJUtuTZ2ODb%2FbmtM8%3D","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.marpolbul.2023.114834"

Based on observed data and numerical simulation results, we studied the characteristics of the suspended sediments and fluid mud in the estuary. By considering two-way coupling of water–sediment density and the process of fine sediment flocculation, a three-dimensional sediment model of the Jiaojiang Estuary was established and effectively calibrated using the measured data on tides, currents, and suspended sediment concentration (SSC). Field data analysis indicated that SSC and sediment transport rate in both the main tidal channel and shoals were positively correlated with the flow velocity in the low-frequency part during both the spring and neap tides. The model results revealed that the net sediment flux is controlled by advection and moves landward upstream of the main tidal channel. Fluid mud is formed near Haimen station, with tides influencing the spatial and temporal variations in its thickness and speed. Sediment is actively exchanged among fluid mud-water-seabed, with sink and source processes dominating near the bay mouth and the Haimen station, respectively. Sediments weaken the seaward residual currents slightly by changing their viscosity and the von Karman constant, and the stratification process is affected by changes in water density.

"Using NFTs and Blockchain for Traceability and Auctioning of Shipping Containers and Cargo in Maritime Industry","","Elmay, Feruz K; Salah, Khaled; Jayaraman, Raja; Omar, Ilhaam A","IEEE Access","Scholarly Journals","","10","","2022-01-01","2022","124507","","124507-124522","21693536","","","ENG","The maritime industry is a complex multi-tiered sector that plays a major role in international shipping and trade. Seaborne transportation is responsible for 90% of goods moved globally, and containerized shipments account for more than 50% of those goods. This volume of movement requires efficient tracking and traceability methods that secure the documentation process and ensure the involved stakeholders. However, due to its complexity, the maritime industry suffers from a lack of trust, lack of ownership evidence, protracted documentation procedures, and excessive data aggregation. These shortcomings are reflected in delays and elevated costs in the shipping process. To mitigate these problems, we propose in this paper a blockchain-based solution for the ownership history and traceability of shipping containers in the industry. Our solution utilizes smart contracts and non-fungible tokens (NFTs) on the Ethereum blockchain to accelerate the inefficient shipping process by digitizing ownership transfer and process documentation. Furthermore, the proposed system allows the owners to auction off their cargo in the destination ports, freeing warehouses and containers in the process. We analyze our proposed system in terms of transaction costs and smart contract security. The smart contracts are developed using the Solidity language in the Remix IDE and the code is made publicly available on GitHub.","https://www.proquest.com/docview/2745128012?accountid=44943&bdid=84593&_bd=i26GEAVmAVl8uQo8op9pHNjqtqc%3D","https://doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2022.3225000"

For governments, accurate shallow water depth inversion in real time is crucial to provide important scientific data for shipping safety, marine engineering and military marine. Recent research in machine learning have shown the dominance on shallow water depth inversion. However, previous methods based on machine learning basically stacked the single remote sensing depth pixel and failed to invert the continuous spatial relationship properly. In addition, the precision is limited by the simple structure and insufficient parameter training of classic artificial neural network (ANN). To remedy these issues, we proposed a spatial-aware neural network (SAN-Net) for shallow water depth inversion. The SAN-Net mainly consists of a spatial-aware feature extraction block (SAB) and a fully connected with dropout feature mapping sub-network (FCDN). The SAB consisting of two convolutional pooling operations can capture the spatial features of the neighborhood and improve the feature expression of shallow water depth inversion. The FCDN is constructed to integrate highly abstract features output from the SAB. Finally, the MSE loss with a regularization term is utilized to constrain the training process. Experiment results on the proposed Shallow Water depth Inversion from WorldView-02 in Mischief Reef (SWIW02-MR) dataset demonstrated that the proposed method outperformed several representative machine learning methods.","https://www.proquest.com/docview/2885914380?accountid=44943&bdid=84593&_bd=LElHcw2qudd2HsXuXtUdWUEihBk%3D","https://doi.org/10.1007/s12524-023-01732-x"

This is one of the first studies of blockchain adoption in the Greek shipping industry, which has not so far been examined by the literature, in direct comparison to early adopters in other European countries such as Norway. The research examined eight Greek shipping companies using workshops with experienced supply chain personnel. Qualitative analysis identified the current position of these organisations in terms of blockchain adoption, by considering possible benefits and inhibitors to implementation. Despite benefits of automated processes and reduced paperwork as a result of smart contracts, findings show a reluctance to adopt BCT.

Finally, we provide a new method to solve port congestion in the maritime supply chain. Therefore, from the perspective of management insight, the port needs to improve the operational efficiency through the blockchain technology with paperless to help consumers to increase the service experience. In addition, the port should also be concerned about the role of blockchain service in the environmental protection and port congestion. In this case, the port can adjust the strategy in order to satisfy the requirements of every stakeholder.","https://www.proquest.com/docview/2675555589?accountid=44943&bdid=84593&_bd=pwwRmu0Qv%2F2WgipGhNvHKcuUaKo%3D","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ocecoaman.2022.106195"

The identification, traceability, and real-time tracking of goods in supply chains have always been a challenge. The advent of the Internet of Things and cloud computing has brought a new approach to the food supply chain process for better cooperation among supply chain partners.

These technologies collect the data relevant to the food supply chain system, such as identifying tag-possessed objects or individuals and sensing capabilities of the surrounding environment. However, the collected data can be tempered or modified by attackers to provide false information about environmental conditions. They can destroy or damage the product due to false identification of dynamic environmental conditions. Furthermore, the current automation systems in industry-based retail logistics and SCM do not provide efficient solutions for monitoring the quality of perishable products with integrated solutions.

The statistics are discouraging and the lack of competence of seafarers is always present in the reports of the investigating authorities. The idea of creating and implementing autonomous ships is cited as a lifeline to overcome the shortcomings that disturb the industry due to the human factor. A few authors in their publications point out many unresolved issues, one of which is related to the education and competence of service personnel. The existing International Convention for Standards of Training, Certification and Watchkeeping of Seafarers does not cover unmanned ships. The mandatory and recommended competencies in it are addressed to the people on board. Some maritime educational institutions have introduced the concept of ""autonomous ship"" in their curricula, such as Nikola Vaptsarov Naval Academy, Varna and Faculty of Maritime Study, Split.

Dense sea fogs reduce visibility at sea and have frequently caused ship collisions. This study used a geographically weighted regression (GWR) model to explore the spatial non-stationarity of near-miss collision risk, as detected by a vessel conflict ranking operator (VCRO) model from automatic identification system (AIS) data under the influence of sea fog in the Bohai Sea. Sea fog was identified by a machine learning method that was derived from Himawari-8 satellite data. The spatial distributions of near-miss collision risk, sea fog, and the parameters of GWR were mapped. The results showed that sea fog and near-miss collision risk have specific spatial distribution patterns in the Bohai Sea, in which near-miss collision risk in the fog season is significantly higher than that outside the fog season, especially in the northeast (the sea area near Yingkou Port and Bayuquan Port) and the southeast (the sea area near Yantai Port). GWR outputs further indicated a significant correlation between near-miss collision risk and sea fog in fog season, with higher R-squared (0.890 in fog season, 2018), than outside the fog season (0.723 in non-fog season, 2018). GWR results revealed spatial non-stationarity in the relationships between-near miss collision risk and sea fog and that the significance of these relationships varied locally.

This reflects the importance of maritime regions as well as the growing demand for more data and knowledge in these remote areas. Currently, the presence of information and communication technologies (ICTs) in offshore settings is limited by the lack of infrastructures, with communications being typically decoupled from the standard Internet or relying on expensive satellite solutions. This paper proposes integrating a commonly available maritime radio-technology, namely very high frequency (VHF) communications, with protocols used in the Internet of Things (IoT). By using the Internet Protocol version 6 (IPv6) over a low-power wireless personal area networks and the constrained application protocol (CoAP), interoperability is ensured between already existing maritime systems and the Internet. An experimental setup is evaluated under different settings and using different configurations. In addition, an analytical assessment of the solutions’ reliability is presented. The obtained results prove the feasibility of using IoT protocols over a VHF link and demonstrate that such an approach outperforms IPv4-based solutions. The conducted assessment reveals that, in constrained settings, configurations at the application layer (e.g., CoAP’s block size in Block-wise transfers) strongly impact the overall performance and reliability of the system. This motivates the development of new maritime solutions based on IPv6 for ensuring a sustainable and ubiquitous development of ICTs even in the most remote locations.","https://www.proquest.com/docview/2169435984?accountid=44943&bdid=84593&_bd=FtLn2wTlSlCKEqPjS2TOtCAoTlQ%3D","https://doi.org/10.1109/JIOT.2018.2868439"

Such vessels need perception for two purposes: to perform autonomous situational awareness and to monitor the integrity of the sensor system itself. In order to meet these needs, the perception system must fuse data from novel and traditional perception sensors using Artificial Intelligence (AI) techniques. This article overviews the recognized operational requirements that are imposed on regular and autonomous seafaring vessels, and then proceeds to consider suitable sensors and relevant AI techniques for an operational sensor system. The integration of four sensors families is considered: sensors for precise absolute positioning (Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) receivers and Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU)), visual sensors (monocular and stereo cameras), audio sensors (microphones), and sensors for remote-sensing (RADAR and LiDAR). Additionally, sources of auxiliary data, such as Automatic Identification System (AIS) and external data archives are discussed. The perception tasks are related to well-defined problems, such as situational abnormality detection, vessel classification, and localization, that are solvable using AI techniques. Machine learning methods, such as deep learning and Gaussian processes, are identified to be especially relevant for these problems.

The data refer to yearly disaggregated (five-digit level Standard International Classification) containerised maritime trade flows on 277 trade routes. With this data-set, a transport costs equation is estimated using linear regression analysis in a panel data framework. The first contribution to the literature is to exploit the greater variability present in the data and to control for unobservable heterogeneous effects. The second is to investigate the role of distance as a determinant of international maritime transport costs in comparison to the location within the liner services network and the potential impact of being peripheral in the liner shipping network. Finally, the work analyses influence of open registries on the variability of maritime transport costs. To the authors' knowledge, this has not been done previously. Three groups of explanatory variables are considered. Firstly, time variant variables: use of open registries and trade imbalance. Secondly, variables related to liner shipping network structures: number of liner services; shipping opportunities; deployed ships and deployed TEUs. Finally, product-related variables such as volume of shipment, value of product and special characteristics of the cargo (i.e. refrigerated cargo). The results allow the quantification of the effects of explanatory variables on international maritime transport costs and to compare the obtained elasticities with previous cross-section analyses. In particular, estimating the impact of the use of open registries on maritime transport cost is a new contribution in this field that could provide policy-makers with valuable information to be used in the implementation of economic policies.

In order to meet the huge demand for wireless communications in maritime environment, mobile edge computing (MEC) is considered as an effective solution to provide powerful computing capabilities for maritime terminals of resource scarcity or latency sensitive. A basic technology to implement MEC is virtual machine (VM) multiplexing, through which multi-task parallel computing on a server is realized. In this paper, a two-layer unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) maritime communication network with a centralized top-UAV (T-UAV) and a group of distributed bottom-UAVs (B-UAVs) is established and MEC is used on T-UAV. We aim to solve the latency minimization problem for both communication and computation in this maritime UAV swarm mobile edge computing network. We reformulate this problem into a Markov decision process (MDP), since it is a non-convex and multiply constrained but has the characteristics of MDP. Based on this MDP model, we take deep reinforcement learning (DRL) as our tool to propose a deep Q-network (DQN) and a deep deterministic policy gradient (DDPG) algorithms to optimize the trajectory of T-UAV and configuration of virtual machines (VMs). Using these two proposed algorithms, we can minimize the system latency.

We consider a shipping network composed of conventional mother ships and autonomous daughter ships that perform cargo transshipment at specific ports. The mother ships sail between Europe and the Norwegian coastline and are conventional due to international regulations. The daughter ships serve small ports located along the Norwegian coastline and are autonomous. We apply this concept of mother and daughter routes to a Norwegian shipping company that transports containers between a continental European port and 21 ports scattered along the Norwegian coastline. Furthermore, we extend this case to a shipping network of 42 ports to study a possible increase in the activity of the company. For solving the corresponding optimization problem, we present a path‐flow‐based model formulation and a heuristic route generation method. We carry out extensive computational experiments that consider differently sized problems, various demand scenarios, advanced routes structures, and sensitivity analyses for cost rates and the degree of automation of the maritime transport system. The results provide evidence that autonomous ships might contribute to considerable cost savings.","https://www.proquest.com/docview/2486620630?accountid=44943&bdid=84593&_bd=LgziqfiGuKE%2F%2FwNpTDLm9jmh7Nc%3D","https://doi.org/10.1111/itor.12788"

In practice, autonomous systems will be extensively tested before being operationally deployed to ensure system behavior is reliable in expected contexts. However, the complexity of autonomous systems means that they will demonstrate emergent behavior in the open context of real-world conflict environments. This article examines the novel implications of emergent behavior of autonomous AI systems designed for conflict through two case studies. These case studies include (1) a swarm system designed for maritime intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance operations, and (2) a next-generation humanitarian notification system. Both case studies represent current or near-future technology in which emergent behavior is possible, demonstrating that such behavior can be both unpredictable and more reliable depending on the level at which the system is considered. This counterintuitive relationship between less predictability and more reliability results in unique challenges for system certification and adherence to the growing body of principles for responsible AI in defense, which must be considered for the real-world operationalization of AI designed for conflict environments.","https://www.proquest.com/docview/2843993020?accountid=44943&bdid=84593&_bd=aPFAKbEPudG8Qx%2Fjc%2FKJgrMSv0Y%3D","https://doi.org/10.1080/15027570.2023.2213985"

This paper proposes a deep learning based non-destructive method of classification of banana fruit under four categories - unripe, under ripe, ripe and over ripe. A customized dataset was prepared with sufficient images in each class. A convolution neural network (CNN) combined with an eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XgBoost) algorithm (CNN-XgBoost) is introduced for the effective determination of the ripening stage of banana. CNN acts as the trainable feature extractor of the images and XgBoost acts as the identifier of ripening stage. Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) is incorporated in order to eliminate the need to have data augmentation or a huge data set. Thus, the proposed deep learning approach possesses capability to perform classification even with a smaller data set compared to conventional deep and machine learning techniques. The performance accuracy of the proposed duo is found to be 91.25% and it is higher than that obtained with a Support Vector Classifier (SVC), Gaussian Naive Bayesian Classifier (GNB) or k-Nearest Neighbours (KNN) algorithms.","https://www.proquest.com/docview/2834263347?accountid=44943&bdid=84593&_bd=%2BbX3N7oe1P4%2F4RfcUrQxt%2Bpp20s%3D","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.postharvbio.2023.112410"

The cyber vulnerability has however been identified as an emerging problem and a potential barrier influencing MASS development. This paper, through the investigation of the fundamental trust problem with regards to the cyber security of MASS systems, aims to develop a blockchain-based scheme for the trust management of MASS. The innovative idea of using blockchain within the MASS context is that the mobile entities in the MASS operational environment constitute a decentralized opportunity network, which makes blockchain an appealing tool to provide a solution to evaluating and maximizing the trust over the dynamics of the entities. This paper elaborates the mechanism by which the MASS entities participate in keeping the main chain. Firstly, the paper illustrates how the Belief of Trust (BoT) among the entities is encoded and assembled into the chain, to allow MASS entities to have an initial judgement towards another entity before they get acquainted. Secondly, at the consensus layer of blockchain technique, it addresses how the witness, who has a temporary right of producing a block and append it to the chain, can be elected among the nodes and how to incent the nodes to maintain the blockchain from a proof-of-stake perspective. Finally, this paper describes how the MASS entities can use the certificate dependence information to evaluate the trust transition in the MASS operating environment. Typical scenarios are delineated to show the procedure of certificate inquiry, handover of controls between maritime supervision centers and shore-side remote control centers in case of the occurrence of unexpected events. The findings provide any entity in an MASS network with an effective solution to evaluating the degree of trust he can have for any targeted node/participant. They can therefore help choose better (more trustable) nodes to maintain the MASS network's knowledge of evidence to judge the trust on an unknown member.","https://www.proquest.com/docview/2628817109?accountid=44943&bdid=84593&_bd=wB2jyPTZtGsRk2t%2FxukcIP9R4L0%3D","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ress.2021.108246"

In this paper, the inversion model of TSM concentration of urban water is constructed using Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) multi-spectral images and measured TSM concentration data. The results show that: (1) The NIR band of the UAV image is highly sensitive to TSM concentration. (2) When the sample size is small, it is found that the TSM regression model is more stable and explanatory than the machine learning model.

To achieve this goal, an ensemble machine learning approach combining the physics-based empirical model is used to perform a regression analysis on two different indicators. The indicators include the engine shaft power and fuel consumption rate per unit time.

Traditional methods are weak in migration capabilities and cumbersome in manual design. Existing deep learning-based methods can achieve high recognition and detection accuracy, but most of them have a very large number of parameters and slow recognition and computational efficiency, which makes it difficult for them to migrate to edge computing equipments, and computational efficiency is crucial in rapid maritime rescue and emergency military deployment. Therefore, we propose a lightweight feature extraction block, lightweight split concat block (LSCB), for SAR automatic target recognition and detection. Specifically, LSCB consists of several operators, such as split, depthwise convolution (DC), multiple kernel sizes block (MKSB), and channel-shuffle (CS). MKSB is a novel channel attention mechanism designed by us, which can make feature maps have target features of different scales and adjust their receptive field sizes adaptively. In addition, to assess the performance of LSCB, we use LSCB to build LSCNet-R and LSCNet-D for SAR target recognition and detection, respectively, and conduct extensive experiments on MSTAR, SSDD, and SAR-Ship-Dataset. The experimental results show that our LSCNet-R and LSCNet-D built with LSCB achieve higher recognition and detection accuracy and computational efficiency with few parameters compared with existing excellent methods. This further illustrates that the proposed LSCB can extract fine and stable features with few parameters.","https://www.proquest.com/docview/2812253282?accountid=44943&bdid=84593&_bd=mmQYObD83OXQMIoupaZQ%2BoiUZMg%3D","https://doi.org/10.1080/01431161.2023.2203342"

Following the recent digitization trend, this research paper examines the relationship between perception and satisfaction on recently implemented digital products and overall customer loyalty in container shipping. Anchored on the technology acceptance model (TAM), a partial least squares structural equation modeling (PLS-SEM) is applied based on the survey conducted on freight forwarders who are major customers of container lines. Results indicate that digital satisfaction and digital trust positively affect overall customer loyalty, while perceived ease of use, perceived usefulness, and digital trust positively influence digital satisfaction. Results of the study show that those digitalized services and operations of container lines have already started to influence overall customer loyalty. This paper provides important theoretical and managerial implications regarding digitalization in container shipping and other non-tech industries.","https://www.proquest.com/docview/2603456698?accountid=44943&bdid=84593&_bd=joZi6G%2BaDhP0fIEjTg%2FsYP3nIbk%3D","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.techfore.2021.121016"

The systems that facilitate maritime shipping are at risk of serious disruptions, and these disruptions can stem from vulnerabilities in the software and processes used in these systems. These vulnerabilities leave such systems open to cyber-attack. Assessments of the security of maritime shipping systems have focused on identifying risks but have not taken the critical (and expensive) next step of actually identifying vulnerabilities present in these systems. While such risk assessments are important, they have not provided the detailed identification of security issues in the systems that control these ports and their terminals. In response, we formed a key collaboration between an experienced academic cybersecurity team and a well-known commercial software provider that manages maritime shipping. We performed an analysis of the information flow involved in the maritime shipping process, and then executed an in-depth vulnerability assessment of the software that manages freight systems. In this paper, we show the flow of information involved in the freight shipping process and explain how we performed the in-depth assessment, summarizing our findings.

However, the resources-constrained maritime users cannot meet the high requirements of transmission delay and energy consumption, due to the excessive traffic and limited resources in maritime networks. To solve this problem, mobile edge computing is taken as a promising paradigm to help mobile devices from edge servers via computation offloading considering the different quality of service (QoS) with the complex ocean environments, resulting in energy saving and increased transmission latency. To investigate the tradeoff between latency and energy consumption in low-cost large-scale maritime communication, we formulate the offloading optimization problem and propose a two-stage joint optimal offloading algorithm, optimizing computation and communication resource allocation under limited energy and sensitive latency. At the first stage, the maritime users make the decision on whether to offload a computation considering their demands and environments. Then, the channel allocation and power allocation problems were proposed to optimize the offloading policy which coordinates with the center cloud servers at the second stage, considering the dynamic tradeoff of latency and energy consumption. Finally, numerical simulation results show the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.","https://www.proquest.com/docview/2424188735?accountid=44943&bdid=84593&_bd=sJSKcHnwqdNY2kiv2fsrvnHiATY%3D","https://doi.org/10.1109/JIOT.2019.2958662"

This revolutionary shift in the shipping industry will heavily impact the reliability of the machinery which is intended to be operated remotely with minimum support from humans. Despite a large amount of research into autonomous navigation and control systems in maritime transportation, the evaluation of unattended engine rooms has received very little attention. For autonomous vessels to be effective during their unmanned mission, it is essential for the engine room understand its health condition and self-manage performance. The unattended machinery plant (UMP) should be resilient enough to have the ability to survive and recover from unexpected perturbations, disruptions, and operational degradations. Otherwise, the system may require unplanned maintenance or the operation will stop. Therefore, the UMP must continue its operation without human intervention and safely return the ship to port. This paper aims to develop a machine learning-based model to predict an UMP's performance and estimate how long the engine room can operate without human assistance. A Random Process Tree is used to model failures in the unattended components, while a Hierarchical Bayesian Inference is adopted to facilitate the prediction of unknown parameters in the process. A probabilistic Bayesian Network developed and evaluated the dependent relationship between active and standby components to assess the effect of redundant units in the performance of unattended machinery. The present framework will provide helpful additional information to evaluate the associate uncertainties and predict the untoward events that put the engine room at risk. The results highlight the model's ability to predict the UMP's trusted operation period and evaluate an unattended engine room's resilience. A real case study of a merchant vessel used for short sea shipping in European waters is considered to demonstrate the model's application.","https://www.proquest.com/docview/2628816003?accountid=44943&bdid=84593&_bd=gdPEYACxYU0FTIWd7mSVPI9V10A%3D","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ress.2021.108176"

In this case, the simulation of a shipping system includes models of operation, cargo loading, fuel loading, and docking for maintenance. In the simulation, various kinds of IoT technologies are defined by several input parameters. By changing the parameters, the simulator evaluates the impact of those technologies quantitatively. As a case study, 11 IoT technologies are evaluated and compared.

To tackle the fickle ocean environment, we propose a novel scheme to extract and identify the fingerprint feature of communication satellite signals. K-means clustering algorithm is utilised to optimise the conventional Smooth Pseudo Wigner-Ville Distribution (SPWVD), which makes the final result of SPWVD closer to the feature of the original data and improves the accuracy of signal fingerprinting. Basing on the improved SPWVD, the singular value entropy is calculated by time-frequency analysis. Then, the entropy of diagonal slices is generated by the ameliorated bispectrum method which is enhanced by using the fractional low-order covariance method. Consequently, a two-dimensional signal fingerprint feature vector can be calculated. For the fingerprint feature recognition, the XGBoost classifier which is more efficient in machine learning classification is employed. Finally, we simulate the Iridium satellite signal for experiments with MATLAB. The experimental result shows the superiority of the improved SPWVD method and the improved bispectrum method, which proves the scheme's feasibility.","https://www.proquest.com/docview/2760694276?accountid=44943&bdid=84593&_bd=FG7Zns5hM3YXgWeIA0LFfKdmJlo%3D","https://doi.org/10.1080/09540091.2022.2133085"

Until early 2000, ship detection relied on human intelligence, but with the fast-processing speed, artificial intelligence (AI), especially deep learning, has replaced manual intervention with automatic localization in tracking naval activities. Taking advantage of the continuous and cloud-free ocean observations of Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR), recent studies have demonstrated some success in utilizing SAR data to localize ships using deep-learning and other AI methods despite the accuracy of the models being lower than the acceptable limit. However, the existing models are inherently complex and time consuming in addition to demanding an extensive computational resource, which pose a significant challenge when applied to satellite-based data. This study presents a computationally efficient deep-learning-based algorithm that has a wider applicability and improves the accuracy over the existing models for ship localization in SAR images. Training and testing of this algorithm were conducted using the SAR Ship Dataset, which contains ship chips with complex backgrounds extracted from Gaofen-3 and Sentinel-1 satellite data. It produced the localized ship’s position with bounding boxes in SAR images using the combined traditional computer vision and deep neural network configuration, which comprises a novel backbone network called Ship-Net or S-Net. The S-Net model has a thirteen-layer backbone feature extraction network and a four-layer regression network concatenated. Further, this study proposes a modified combined loss function for optimizing the model performance. A comparative analysis of the proposed S-Net model was done using the various pre-build model architectures and loss function combinations. The results showed that the S-Net model with a combined loss function yielded 94.88% precision and 79.68% recall, with 12.58% precision and 7.39% recall higher than the state-of-the-art Faster RCNN baseline model. The proposed S-Net model has a relatively higher performance than the existing state-of-the-art models for ship localization in SAR images and can become an efficient tool for ship localization in optical images with suitable architectural and training scheme modifications for better coastal surveillance and worldwide naval security.","https://www.proquest.com/docview/2862610213?accountid=44943&bdid=84593&_bd=9xJ%2BTggAY6L81EZKWsrDWsddNjw%3D","https://doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2023.3310539"

In this paper, we investigate the value of blockchain-based vertical cooperation led by a port or a shipping company in a one-to-two shipping service competition model. A status quo scenario and two different investment scenarios led by different stakeholders are constructed, and equilibrium solutions of the Stackelberg game in three scenarios are proposed. Meanwhile, consumer surplus and social welfare under different cooperation frameworks are discussed. We find that i) investment in blockchain technology can significantly increase the profits of shipping supply chain participants. ii) From the point of view of profit, when the investment efficiency of the port and the shipping company satisfies a certain relationship, there is a balanced strategy for both parties to invest in blockchain technology. iii) The more intense the competition for the services of shipping companies, the lower the level of blockchain technology to improve the logistics capabilities of the shipping supply chain participants. iv) The port's investment in blockchain technology brings more consumer surplus and social welfare. The abovementioned findings can provide managerial insights for ports and shipping companies and present decision support for the government to formulate blockchain technology promotion policies.","https://www.proquest.com/docview/2718263325?accountid=44943&bdid=84593&_bd=ju6d3zMOzIbi4OMvo6BnrhSBYK0%3D","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ocecoaman.2022.106263"

Recent security breaches cost shipping companies hundreds of millions of dollars and put marine ecosystems at risk by disabling ship controls and increasing risks of collisions and hazmat spills. Additionally, most new ships are designed to transmit engine performance data ashore to allow timely maintenance and efficient operation. However, many ships still prohibit such data transmission due to security concerns, resulting in increased ship emissions and environmental risks from accidental release of oil, hydraulic fluids, or lubricants. Similarly, research vessel data are routinely sent ashore, but security concerns for their computers are also increasing, especially when they operate in global ports and oceans. Maritime cybersecurity is also critical as autonomous ships are being developed. Addressing maritime cybersecurity is therefore a valid area of scientific policy research and important for ocean science operations.The International Maritime Organization (IMO) has called for improved maritime cybersecurity, and the U.S. Coast Guard also recently released a Navigation and Vessel Inspection Circular (NVIC; NVIC 05-17) on maritime cybersecurity for comments. The newly established Maritime Cyber Security Committee of the Marine Technology Society is coordinating maritime cybersecurity best practice information, contacts for cybersecurity professionals, and lessons learned on responding to cyberattacks to make this information broadly available. We review here various stakeholder approaches to maritime cybersecurity, outline available resources, and discuss how advanced methods, including optical communications and quantum encryption, will improve maritime cybersecurity. Scientists have a role in developing and implementing maritime cybersecurity methods and policies to ensure safe ship operations and improved environmental security for the oceans.","https://www.proquest.com/docview/2118594998?accountid=44943&bdid=84593&_bd=ViZA6N8fTIS9kctoqJrGEWBP3ZQ%3D","https://doi.org/10.4031/MTSJ.52.5.11"

In view of this, an anomaly detection model for ship trajectory data based on Gaussian Mixture Variational Autoencoder (GMVAE) is proposed in this study using an unsupervised classification method. The proposed model modifies Variational Autoencoder (VAE) by changing the inferential distribution of prior distribution and approximate posterior to the Gaussian mixture model. A high-dimensional hidden space is constructed to learn the features of multi-class trajectory data, and the Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) method is applied to measure the error between the reconstructed trajectory and the original trajectory in order to judge whether the ship trajectory is abnormal. The Automatic Identification System (AIS) data from the US coastal areas are used to verify the proposed model, and the results are compared with other commonly used models in a manually labeled dataset. The research results indicate that the detection rate of the proposed model is 91.26%, and the false alarm rate is 0.68%, which performs the best. Using the Gaussian mixture model to describe the distribution of hidden space can improve the learning ability of multi-class trajectories of VAE, thus increasing the robustness of the model.

The ship-owners are looking more and more to optimize the operational cost of ship, to monitor remotely the cargo and to ensure a satisfactory level of safety and security, in compliance with the international maritime organization requirements. As per international convention for the safety of life at sea requirements, a conventional ship must carry a global maritime distress safety system, depending on the sea areas where it is operating. We assume that assuring a reliable communication service in the shipping industry is a challenging issue, in an era of internet of things and the need for a ship to be continuously connected to its ecosystem. This connectivity should be with a high data rate transmission. However, the future implementation of autonomous ship beside the existing conventional ship as an alternative for a sustainable maritime industry, requires the implementation of a reliable and cost-effective communication carrier, capable to transfer operational data on live basis from ship-to-ship and from ship-to-shore without interruption with a very low latency. To achieve this goal, we propose in this work, the implementation of 5G network as a maritime communication carrier, using unmanned aerial vehicle base stations, which are placed at optimum positions. This placement results in a maximization of uplink and downlink communication data rate, low latency and efficient optimization of transmission power. These make of 5G a potential maritime communication service carrier, capable to support the safe operation of deep-sea conventional vessels and the future deployment of autonomous ships.","https://www.proquest.com/docview/3091790231?accountid=44943&bdid=84593&_bd=MBQGw4Q7aH1nqWoKctZFCTSAPXc%3D","https://doi.org/10.4028/www.scientific.net/JERA.51.229"

Taking into account these characteristics, a single-user single-hop unicast offloading model is established and extends to a multi-user model. In addition, for the sufficient and limited edge computing nodes, the multi-user model is further divided into the multi-user single-hop unicast situation 1 and 2 models. We split the mixed-integer nonlinear programming problem and approximate the optimal transmission power by the binary search method. We use the offloading decision allocation algorithm based on alternating selection, offloading decision allocation algorithm based on multi-objective alternating selection, and offloading decision allocation algorithm based on node redistribution to optimize the offloading decisions of the above models.

On the one hand, weather conditions can lead to speed loss phenomenon of ships, which may result in the failure of ships’ punctual arrivals.

The estimated parameters are chlorophyll-a, total suspended matter (TSM), and chromophoric dissolved organic matter (CDOM). The Sentinel-3 OLCI remote sensing imageries were analyzed for the duration of October 2018 to February 2019. We observed that the water quality of the Hooghly estuaries is comparatively low-oxygenated, mesotrophic, and phosphate-limited. Ongoing channel dredging for maintaining shipping channel depth keeps the TSM in the estuary at an elevated level, with the highest amount of TSM observed during March of 2019 (41.59g m⁻³) at station A, upstream point. Since the pre-monsoon season, TSM data shows a decreasing trend towards the mouth of the estuary. Chl-a concentration is higher during pre-monsoon than monsoon and post-monsoon periods, with the highest value observed in April at 1.09 mg m⁻³ in station D during the pre-monsoon period. The CDOM concentration was high in the middle section (January–February) and gradually decreased towards the estuary’s head and mouth. The highest CDOM was found in February at locations C and D during the pre-monsoon period. Every station shows a significant correlation among CDOM, TSM, and Chl-a measured parameters.

Using laser-pulse techniques, DAS turns (commercial) fiber-optic cables into seismic arrays with a spatial sampling density of the order of meters and a time sampling rate up to one thousand Hertz. The versatility of DAS enables dense instrumentation of traditionally inaccessible domains, such as urban, glaciated, and submarine environments. This in turn opens up novel applications such as traffic density monitoring and maritime vessel tracking. However, these new environments also introduce new challenges in handling various types of recorded noise, impeding the application of traditional data analysis workflows. In order to tackle the challenges posed by noise, new denoising techniques need to be explored that are tailored to DAS. In this work, we propose a Deep Learning approach that leverages the spatial density of DAS measurements to remove spatially incoherent noise with unknown characteristics. This approach is entirely self-supervised, so no noise-free ground truth is required, and it makes no assumptions regarding the noise characteristics other than that it is spatio-temporally incoherent. We apply our approach to both synthetic and real-world DAS data to demonstrate its excellent performance, even when the signals of interest are well below the noise level.

It is considered as one of the main influencing factors affecting maritime safety. It can be estimated quantitatively through the analysis of traffic data. To explore maritime ship traffic in more detail, a predictive analytics method utilizing the Lempel-Ziv algorithm and the Technique for Order Preference by Similarity to an Ideal Solution (TOPSIS) for traffic safety management is proposed. The Lempel-Ziv algorithm quantifies the entropy for the evaluation of the irregularity and unpredictability of ship travel time sequences, and TOPSIS ranks complexity. The results presented utilize Automatic Identification System (AIS) data corresponding to complex inland waterway traffic scenarios encountered in the Yangtze River. They show that high complexity implies ship travel time sequences are neither periodic nor stochastic, but dependent on the evolution patterns of traffic encounters. A correlation analysis of traffic flow complexity with the number of maritime accidents is carried out, showing that higher traffic flow complexity may result in more unwanted events. It is therefore concluded that the proposed method may help to (1) differentiate traffic flow complexity accurately, indicating that the higher the complexity value is, the higher the irregularity and unpredictability of maritime traffic flow are, (2) provide helpful reference for optimizing traffic management over the life cycle of fleet operations as well as maritime safety management of high traffic flow complexity areas.","https://www.proquest.com/docview/2639039773?accountid=44943&bdid=84593&_bd=WxLcHOz4Hn19FK4GuT1%2FrPYMY1A%3D","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ress.2021.108317"

The application of machine learning (ML) techniques to uncover causes of shipping container damage allows for more efficient handling of the service-disruptions they cause, as well as insights into the veracity of the current wisdom held by domain experts in the industry. Further, the application of ML methodologies for dynamic algorithm selection (per level 4 of the JDL/DFIG data fusion model) allows for significant improvements to the overall performance of the aforementioned ML methodologies.","https://www.proquest.com/docview/2622913514?accountid=44943&bdid=84593&_bd=MbkHFXaWn2N81Cfks%2B3BJ4y0sWI%3D","https://doi.org/10.1504/IJLSM.2021.120530"

Analogue data has given way to digital data, which provides an opportunity for better storage, analysis and transfer. Data infusion and management has become the key constraint in respect of data collection. Using data to make decisions requires the appropriate tools and processes to assess and transfer data to near real-time user domains. In the maritime environment, there is a constantly growing demand for intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance (ISR) data for both national security and commercial purposes, including data sharing among partner nations. However, an increase in available data does not automatically equate to an increase in decision-ready information. Rather, the increase in data can overwhelm sensors, databases and analysts. The concept and use of ""big data"" exacerbate the already overwhelming flow of data in terms of the volume, variety, and velocity of the data being received.

However, there are security-specific challenges with the authentication of drones while airborne. The current authentication approaches, in most drone-based applications, are subject to latency issues in real time with security vulnerabilities for attacks. To address such issues, we introduce a secure authentication model with low latency for drones in smart cities that looks to leverage blockchain technology. We apply a zone-based architecture in a network of drones, and use a customized decentralized consensus, known as drone-based delegated proof of stake (DDPOS), for drones among zones in a smart city that does not require reauthentication. The proposed architecture aims for positive impacts on increased security and reduced latency on the Internet of Drones (IoD). Moreover, we provide an empirical analysis of the proposed architecture compared to other peer models previously proposed for IoD to demonstrate its performance and security authentication capability. The experimental results clearly show that not only does the proposed architecture have low packet loss rate, high throughput, and low end-to-end delay in comparison to peer models but also can detect 97.5% of attacks by malicious drones while airborne.","https://www.proquest.com/docview/2510426394?accountid=44943&bdid=84593&_bd=%2BhFx1QGOot9ewZnqn0fiBKa%2FNIo%3D","https://doi.org/10.1109/JIOT.2020.3015382"

Most of today’s systems and technologies leveraged for managing shipping containers in unimodal and multimodal logistics fall short of providing transparency, traceability, reliability, audit, security, and trust features. In this paper, we propose a blockchain-based solution that allows users to trace and track their container shipments in a manner that is decentralized, transparent, auditable, secure, and trustworthy.

Refrigeration is also key to enable successful transcontinental export to distant markets. To minimize the environmental impact of the cold chain and to optimize logistics, a better knowledge of the fruit quality evolution within individual shipments would be extremely valueable. For this purpose, a digital fruit twin is developed, based on mechanistic modeling. This digital twin simulates the thermal behavior of mango fruit throughout the cold chain, based on the measured environmental temperature conditions, namely the air temperature in the vicinity of the fruit. At the same time, the evolution of associated quality attributes, due to enzymatically-driven, temperature-dependent biochemical degradation reactions, is quantified. Also, a biophysical counterpart of real mango fruit – an innovative fruit simulator sensing device – was developed and used for model validation of fruit pulp temperatures. We identified – in-silico – the impact of the unique delivery air temperature history and cold chain length on fruit quality evolution for actual maritime vs. airfreight transport pathways. Digital twins were found to provide complementary insights in the thermophysical behavior of fruit, particularly in supply chains of very perishable species, and for storage at low airflow rates. Such mechanistic modeling enabled to understand, record, and predict where temperature-dependent fruit quality loss occurs in each supply chain. In that way, digital twins can help to improve refrigeration processes and logistics to reduce food losses, thereby making the refrigerated supply chain greener.","https://www.proquest.com/docview/2286853175?accountid=44943&bdid=84593&_bd=d3Laet%2B9OA2OxkYFyMMnZk1Fub0%3D","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.resconrec.2019.06.002"

Such challenges are: the volume of transactions, communication hurdles and the lack of contemporary management tools. The paper proposes a comprehensive framework to assess the impact of blockchain implementation in the midstream LNG supply chain in order to tackle those barriers.Design/methodology/approach>The basis of the research is the business process modelling (BPM), through which entities, roles, tasks, resources and transactions can be modelled and simulated. The modelling of the midstream LNG supply chain, via BPM, is based on guidelines of the Society of International Gas Tanker and Terminal Operators (SIGGTO) and common industry business models. A quantitative analysis is employed to support the motivation and the potential impact of blockchain implementation. The methodology is used to identify (1) inefficiencies related to large volume of transactions between stakeholders and (2) critical areas of an LNG shipping company, where blockchain can be implemented.Findings>Process repeatability, numerous shared documentation forms, excessive paperwork and communication imbroglios are mapped from the modelling section. Up to 327 processes are repeated during a typical vessel voyage, and up to 122 shared documentation forms are exchanged. Excessive paperwork and communication imbroglios are tracked through, which correspond to 25 severe errors as detected. By implementing the methodology, stakeholders can quantify the possible impact of blockchain on the operational performance of each stakeholder's operations separately and the supply chain as a whole in terms of real-time monitoring, transparency and paperwork reduction, time and cost savings.Research limitations/implications>The research has certain limitations deriving from its conceptual nature. The business processes' modelling is based on standard procedures described in the guidelines by SIGGTO and may need further adjustment for specific use cases. A structured case study has not been realisable as corporate data for an LNG shipping company regarding processes and other commercial sensitive information are required.Practical implications>Potential practitioners may exploit the proposed framework as a low cost and seamless tool to evaluate how blockchain could disrupt their operations. Thus, the blockchain implementation's improvements or weaknesses can be pinpointed, and enabling the interested stakeholder of the LNG supply chain with specific feedback, it can guide them towards informed decisions on their operations.Originality/value>The research has a novel approach as it combines the creation of practical management framework, with a comprehensive visualization of the midstream LNG supply chain. Thus, the reader can identify in which parts of the midstream LNG supply chain can blockchain be implemented, and what impact it could have in terms of supply chain operations.","https://www.proquest.com/docview/2637834985?accountid=44943&bdid=84593&_bd=QWYeG0E8p4IUPdvYTEYaSJF5LrY%3D","https://doi.org/10.1108/MABR-03-2021-0023"

Recently, as a result of FTAs(Free Trade Agreements) between countries, worldwide cargo volume by ship is expected to keep on rising due to the unification of economic zones. Such an increase in maritime transportation leads to a maritime traffic, and this poses a greater risk of marine accidents in a country’s coastal water. Moreover, such risk factors that are threatening the safety of ships’ navigation such as embarkation of multinational seafarer, piracy, changes in maritime climate by global warming and the like are in occurrence. What’s more, the mounting traffic of yacht and pleasure boats in littoral sea as a result of the increase in maritime leisure activities triggers higher possibilities of marine accidents. To cope with such changes in maritime environment well, it requires higher safety management abilities & skills from shipping companies, the main subject in charge of the safety matters. However, shipping companies tend to acknowledge safety just as a form of cost without profitability. They particularly have more tendencies to be inactive in managing ship safety and investment during a dull shipping season.

There are, however, many safety and reliability assurance challenges in autonomous operational and navigation systems due to their complex, adaptive, and non-deterministic nature. The issue of a mixed navigational environment where conventionally manned, remotely controlled, and unmanned vessels are interacting at the same sea area can be considered as one of the major obstacles in adopting of autonomous ships. Vulnerabilities can increase due to the potential divergence of vessel state awareness between autonomous operational systems and humans in such situations. Little research to date has dealt with such safety issues that a mix of human-operated, remotely controlled, and autonomous vessels will bring.

As sailing races are large-scale regattas that require massive workforces to monitor the game fairly; however, with limited match budgets and labors, Internet of Things (IoT) technology supports monitoring games has become a trend. This article proposes a robot umpire system in sailing races based on Artificial Intelligence (AI) techniques, using drones and AIoT technology to monitor sailing matches. When a large number of sailboats are in a match, and each sail along different routes, drones can monitor the entire game simultaneously. The features of this proposed approach are (1) The system recognizes images by Faster R-CNN, judging whether a sailboat uses a motor to accelerate; (2) The system detects conditions by edge computing; when cheating behaviors happen, it can notify the event holder immediately; (3) Advanced drone route plans can avoid collision incidents; (4) Improve the system recognition by federated learning. This study has implemented an experiment with real drones and installed IoT equipment on the drones for taking videos and recognizing. The experimental result has shown that the proposed approach is feasible and benefits the match's fairness. Additionally, umpires can review the violation details from the videos taken by the drones, supporting evidence for judging.","https://www.proquest.com/docview/2740907063?accountid=44943&bdid=84593&_bd=QV%2BCzs6AOELS6FldEFxawS6f1Zg%3D","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2022.979657"

As to be expected, business management is critical for the maritime industry, requiring highly trained individuals and teams to lead the development, implementation and control of sound contemporary management practices. Maritime business degrees are developed by universities to meet such demand by providing graduates with sufficient skills for the onshore business-related roles. This empirical study conducted in Australia, USA and Canada, investigates current and future industry employability skills for maritime business graduates through focus groups, individual interviews and an online survey with senior managers in maritime organisations. This study found the important employability skills for maritime business graduates which include communication, problem solving, adaptability, self-management, team work, and digital literacy and technology. Demand for digital literacy and technology knowledge and skills have increased due to the maritime industry having a trend of moving towards digitalisation and automation. However, the survey findings revealed that a skills focus for maritime business graduates will not be the technology itself but the use and management of technology. In relation to future skills/knowledge required from maritime business degree graduates in 10 years’ time, communication and adaptability are recognised as being the most important. Employers expect that maritime business graduates should be able to adopt new technology and be competent in communication, and be more adaptable given the highly dynamic nature of the maritime industry.

Current maritime communication networks (MCNs) mainly rely on marine satellites and on-shore base stations (BSs). The former generally provides limited transmission rate, while the latter lacks wide-area coverage capability. Due to these facts, the state-of-the-art MCN falls far behind terrestrial fifth-generation (5G) networks. To fill up the gap in the coming sixth-generation (6G) era, we explore the benefit of deployable BSs for maritime coverage enhancement. Both unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) and mobile vessels are used to configure deployable BSs. This leads to a hierarchical satellite-UAV-terrestrial network on the ocean. We address the joint link scheduling and rate adaptation problem for this hybrid network, to minimize the total energy consumption with quality of service (QoS) guarantees. Different from previous studies, we use only the large-scale channel state information (CSI), which is location-dependent and thus can be predicted through the position information of each UAV/vessel based on its specific trajectory/shipping lane. The problem is shown to be an NP-hard mixed integer nonlinear programming problem with a group of hidden non-linear equality constraints. We solve it suboptimally by using Min-Max transformation and iterative problem relaxation, leading to a process-oriented joint link scheduling and rate adaptation scheme. As observed by simulations, the scheme can provide agile on-demand coverage for all users with much reduced system overhead and a polynomial computation complexity. Moreover, it can achieve a prominent performance close to the optimal solution.","https://www.proquest.com/docview/2582250583?accountid=44943&bdid=84593&_bd=M2tm9DFf0ayDbBskChnAsDuZ6W4%3D","https://doi.org/10.1109/JSAC.2021.3088692"

Global supply chains create a complex network of trade flows. The structure of this network impacts not only the socioeconomic development of the concerned regions but also their ecosystems. The movements of ships are a considerable source of CO2 emissions and contribute to climate change. In the wake of the announced development of Arctic shipping, the need to understand the behavior of the maritime trade network and to predict future trade flows becomes pressing. We use a unique database of daily movements of the world fleet over the period 1977–2008 and apply machine learning techniques on network data to develop models for predicting the opening of new shipping lines and for forecasting trade volume on links. We find that the evolution of this system is governed by a simple rule from network science, relying on the number of common neighbors between pairs of ports. This finding is consistent over all three decades of temporal data. We further confirm it with a natural experiment, involving traffic redirection from the port of Kobe after the 1995 earthquake. Our forecasting method enables researchers and industry to easily model effects of potential future scenarios at the level of ports, regions, and the world. Our results also indicate that maritime trade flows follow a form of random walk on the underlying network structure of sea connections, highlighting its pivotal role in the development of maritime trade.","https://www.proquest.com/docview/2412330429?accountid=44943&bdid=84593&_bd=L0MWtJ7hw7OIIPDBdQZq2ydfN5s%3D","https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1906670117"

Such information is collected as large-scale data sets, the so-called Big Data, that should be utilized towards digitalization of the shipping industry. However, various data handling challenges are encountered by the shipping industry during the phase of digitalization, onboard as well as onshore. Data-driven models, the so-called digital models, to support data handling frameworks of the shipping industry are proposed by this study. Such models can overcome the respective data handling challenges in shipping, where conventional mathematical models may fail to facilitate. These models can be derived from ship performance and navigation data sets by considering the high-dimensional parameter space. Such high-dimensional models consist of several data clusters and each data cluster may consist of a possible unique data structure. These data clusters often relate to sub-operational conditions of vessels and ship systems. The identification of the distribution of data clusters and the structure of each data cluster in relation to ship performance and navigation conditions have been done under this study for a selected vessel as the main contribution.

The aim of this paper was to analyse accidents involving automated technologies across the transport modes to identify learning opportunities that could be applied in the design of automated vehicles and the wider road systems within which they will operate. Twenty-two investigation reports into automation-related accidents in transport modes traditionally using automation (aviation, maritime and rail) were identified and analysed using the AcciMap technique, with factors codified using a contributing factors taxonomy and analysed using network metrics. To determine their relevance to road automation, the results were compared with an analysis of three recent investigation reports into automated vehicle crashes. The comparison revealed similarities and differences between the contributory factors in the traditional modes and the emerging set of road automation crashes. Two key leverage points were identified: improved human factors integration into the design of automation in all modes; and re-consideration of regulatory approaches across transport domains to ensure they are appropriate for emerging technologies and their associated risks. The analysis also provides support for the utility of previously developed contributory factors taxonomy applied to compare transport domains.","https://www.proquest.com/docview/2725641774?accountid=44943&bdid=84593&_bd=lnpUNWogo%2F1y2z6smlNUk6TZ40s%3D","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ssci.2022.105822"

However, the current approach to automation design does not relieve the soldier operator of tasks; rather, it changes the role of the soldiers and the work they must do, often in ways unintended and unanticipated. This paper proposes a coherent, top-down, overarching approach to the design of a human--automation interaction model. First, a qualitative model is proposed to drive the functional architecture and human--automation interface scheme for the MGV fleet. Second, the proposed model is applied to a portion of the functional flow of the common crew station on the MGV fleet. Finally, the proposed model is demonstrated quantitatively via a computational task-network modeling program (Improved Performance Research and Integration Tool). The modeling approach offers insights into the impacts on human task-loading, workload, and human performance. Implications for human systems integration domains are discussed, including Manpower and Personnel, Human Factors Engineering, Training, System Safety, and Soldier Survivability. The proposed model gives engineers and scientists a top-down approach to explicitly define and design the interactions between proposed automation schemes and the human crew.

This energy source relies on industrial control systems and IT to support operations and maintenance activities, which create a pathway for an adversary to gain unauthorized access to systems and data and disrupt operations. Incorporating cybersecurity risk prevention measures and mitigation capabilities from inception, development, operation, to decommissioning of the MRE system and components is paramount to the protection of energy generation and the security of network architecture and infrastructure. To improve the resilience of MRE systems as a predictable, affordable, and reliable source of energy, cybersecurity guidance was developed to enable operators to assess cybersecurity risks and implement security measures commensurate with the risk. This publication is the second of a two-part series, with Part 1 addressing a framework to determine cybersecurity risk by assessing the vulnerability of an MRE system to potential cyber threats and the consequences a cyberattack would have on the end user. This Part 2 publication describes an approach to select appropriate cybersecurity best practices commensurate with the MRE system's cybersecurity risk. The guidance includes 86 cybersecurity best practices, which are associated with 36 cybersecurity domains and grouped into nine categories. The best practices follow the core functions of the National Institute of Science and Technology Cybersecurity Framework (e.g., identify, detect, protect, respond, and and recover) and insights from both maritime and energy industry guidance documents to identify security measures effective in protecting information and operational technology assets prevalent in MRE systems.","https://www.proquest.com/docview/2575277308?accountid=44943&bdid=84593&_bd=cOGhwRYKKiRxVSUdGK4vFQZ9nPQ%3D","https://doi.org/10.4031/MTSJ.55.2.4"

While slow steaming is widely used as best practices for liner shipping companies, they are also under the pressure to maintain service level agreement (SLA) with their cargo clients. Thus, deciding optimal speed that minimizes fuel consumption while maintaining SLA is managerial decision problem. Studies in the literature use theoretical fuel consumption functions in their speed optimization models but these functions have limitations due to weather conditions in voyages. This paper uses weather archive data to estimate the real fuel consumption function for speed optimization problems. In particular, Copernicus data set is used as the source of big data and data mining technique is applied to identify the impact of weather conditions based on a given voyage route. Particle swarm optimization, a metaheuristic optimization method, is applied to find Pareto optimal solutions that minimize fuel consumption and maximize SLA. The usefulness of the proposed approach is verified through the real data obtained from a liner company and real world implications are discussed.","https://www.proquest.com/docview/2111553783?accountid=44943&bdid=84593&_bd=GafHbYz54%2Fk2jKz5z5bXTqQ6yVQ%3D",""

In particular, ship detection is recognized as one of the core research issues of these IoT-driven intelligent marine surveillance systems. Traditional methods based on machine learning have made some achievements in detection tasks for specific objects. However, the ship objects are relatively small, and they are usually not accurately detected. In this article, we propose an electroencephalography (EEG)-based maritime object detection algorithm for IoT-driven surveillance systems in the smart ocean. For this purpose, we conduct experiments to record the EEG signals of subjects when they are watching the maritime image scenes. With the feature analysis of EEG signals, the event-related potential (ERP) components associated with detecting objects are induced, such as the [Formula Omitted] and [Formula Omitted] components. Employing classification based on linear discriminant analysis (LDA), the area under curve (AUC) of the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) is used to evaluate the detection accuracy. We use this novel method to determine and identify essential objects and areas from IoT devices, such as digital camera imaging sensors. Our proposed method can not only help to detect small objects accurately using fewer samples but can also be used to reduce the data volume needed to be stored and transmitted in IoT-driven marine surveillance systems.","https://www.proquest.com/docview/2449951393?accountid=44943&bdid=84593&_bd=drD1N1LCJu19DF9Ht%2FqWmouUgtY%3D","https://doi.org/10.1109/JIOT.2020.2991025"

However, neither regulatory rules nor related studies have been specified or made available in the literature regarding such interference. This paper utilizes the electromagnetic power flux density (PFD) mask concept for evaluating and constraining the emission onto earth from a satellite space station. The mathematical analysis and derivation are based on the principle that the actual interference from a space station that a land system experiences is no worse than that from any other land system allowed by the regulations.

Then, the performances are evaluated given in terms of average data rate and outage probability in the hierarchical maritime radio networks. When evaluating the performances, heterogeneous channel characteristics of the hierarchical networks are taken into account in which Rayleigh fading is considered for the MUE-ship links, whereas shadowed-Rician fading is considered for the ship-DA links. Moreover, the effects due to various transmission errors that can be occurred at different communication layers are reflected in determining the quality of service (QoS) requirements of a ship. With the help of authors' analysis, an antenna selection algorithm is proposed under which the minimum size of a service cloud can be found to support the QoS requirements of MUEs with a ship.

Avoiding malfunctions could also improve the ship’s overall environmental “footprint” and even ensure reduced fuel consumption.

This research was carried out via the cost-free Weka data mining tool, which was used to analyze the data of the engine’s operating parameters that were found outside of the prescribed boundaries. The proposed method is based on the construction of an ensemble classification model “AdaBoost”, which further improves the performance of a basic Simple Cart classifier. During the related experimental activities, the overall recorded performance was 96.5%, clearly establishing this method as a very appropriate choice.","https://www.proquest.com/docview/2396323556?accountid=44943&bdid=84593&_bd=KjkjWjajNI9R%2BPdYis7R4LdFw8Q%3D","https://doi.org/10.1007/s13437-019-00192-w"

These ground-breaking techniques have promoted the rapid development of Internet of Things (IoT) in maritime industries. In maritime IoT applications, intelligent vessel traffic services can be guaranteed by collecting and analyzing high volume of spatial data flows from automatic identification system (AIS). This AIS system includes a highly integrated automatic equipment, including functionalities of core communication, tracking, and sensing. The increased utilization of shipboard AIS devices allows the collection of massive trajectory data. However, the received raw AIS data often suffers from undesirable outliers (i.e., poorly tracked timestamped points for vessel trajectories ) during signal acquisition and analog-to-digital conversion. The degraded AIS data will bring negative effects on vessel traffic services (e.g., maritime traffic monitoring, intelligent maritime navigation, vessel collision avoidance, etc.) in maritime IoT scenarios. To improve the quality of vessel trajectory records from AIS networks, we propose to develop a two-phase data-driven machine learning framework for vessel trajectory reconstruction. In particular, a density-based clustering method is introduced in the first phase to automatically recognize the undesirable outliers. The second phase proposes a bidirectional long short-term memory (BLSTM)-based supervised learning technique to restore the timestamped points degraded by random outliers in vessel trajectories. Comprehensive experiments on simulated and realistic data sets have verified the dominance of our two-phase vessel reconstruction framework compared to other competing methods. It thus has the capacity of promoting intelligent vessel traffic services in 6G-enabled maritime IoT systems.","https://www.proquest.com/docview/2505609655?accountid=44943&bdid=84593&_bd=K%2BiMaAO56fh%2FFVu1CcmF%2BkLOCRU%3D","https://doi.org/10.1109/JIOT.2020.3028743"

Seaports are the most critical point in the maritime logistics chain because of its multimodal and complex nature. Consequently, coordinated communication among any seaport stakeholders is vital to improving their operations. Currently, Electronic Data Interchange (EDI) and Port Community Systems (PCS), as primary enablers of digital seaports, have demonstrated their limitations to interchange information on time, accurately, efficiently, and securely, causing high operation costs, low resource management, and low performance. For these reasons, this contribution presents the Seaport Data Space (SDS) based on the Industrial Data Space (IDS) reference architecture model to enable a secure data sharing space and promote an intelligent transport multimodal terminal. Each seaport stakeholders implements the IDS connector to take part in the SDS and share their data. On top of SDS, a Big Data architecture is integrated to manage the massive data shared in the SDS and extract useful information to improve the decision-making. The architecture has been evaluated by enabling a port authority and a container terminal to share its data with a shipping company. As a result, several Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) have been developed by using the Big Data architecture functionalities.

The corridors were created as a strategic framework to guide Federal investments in marine transportation in the Arctic. With new government investment, under the Oceans Protection Plan (OPP), the corridors initiative, known as the Northern Low-Impact Shipping Corridors, will continue to be developed. Since 2016, the Canadian Hydrographic Service (CHS) has been using the corridors as a key layer in a geographic information system (GIS) model known as the CHS Priority Planning Tool (CPPT). The CPPT helps CHS prioritize its survey and charting efforts in Canada’s key traffic areas. Even with these latest efforts, important gaps in the surveys still need to be filled in order to cover the Canadian waterways. To help further develop the safety to navigation and improve survey mission planning, CHS has also been exploring new technologies within remote sensing. Under the Government Related Initiatives Program (GRIP) of the Canadian Space Agency (CSA), CHS has been investigating the potential use of Earth observation (EO) data to identify potential hazards to navigation that are not currently charted on CHS products. Through visual interpretation of satellite imagery, and automatic detection using artificial intelligence (AI), CHS identified several potential hazards to navigation that had previously gone uncharted. As a result, five notices to mariners (NTMs) were issued and the corresponding updates were applied to the charts. In this study, two AI approaches are explored using deep learning and machine learning techniques: the convolution neural network (CNN) and random forest (RF) classification. The study investigates the effectiveness of the two models in identifying shoals in Sentinel-2 and WorldView-2 satellite imagery. The results show that both CNN and RF models can detect shoals with accuracies ranging between 79 and 94% over two study sites; however, WorldView-2 images deliver results with higher accuracy and lower omission errors. The high processing times of using high-resolution imagery and training a deep learning model may not be necessary in order to quickly scan images for shoals; but training a CNN model with a large training set may lead to faster processing times without the need to train individual images.","https://www.proquest.com/docview/2574340212?accountid=44943&bdid=84593&_bd=L%2F5ySVrfszHAFiHR3WiW8lU%2B7GE%3D","https://doi.org/10.3390/ijgi9060383"

Mobile edge computing driven by powerful computing capability and edge intelligence is taken as a promising solution, especially for the resource-constrained and delay-sensitive maritime IoT users. In this paper, we study the optimal edge server selection problem for ship IoT users to jointly minimize the latency and energy consumption for task offloading. Specifically, we first propose a novel space-air-ground-edge (SAGE) integrated maritime network architecture to offload computation-intensive IoT services at sea. Then, the latency and energy consumption of data transmission and processing during offloading are modelled. Based on the models, the edge server selection problem is formulated into a Multi-Armed Bandits learning problem, with considering the task latency requirement and energy budget. To achieve the optimal solution, a novel algorithm, referred to as UCB1-ESSS, is developed, which links the latency, energy consumption, and network constraints by introducing both reward and cost. The simulation results show that the proposed algorithm can achieve considerably lower offloading latency and weighted latency-energy cost compared with the traditional algorithms under different QoS requirements, which proves the efficacy of theproposed algorithm.","https://www.proquest.com/docview/2659343767?accountid=44943&bdid=84593&_bd=dX6mrfdfaNWpDqtXwZLPf%2FzgES4%3D","https://doi.org/10.1109/TVT.2022.3141740"

A Multinomial Process Tree is used to model failures in the main failure-sensitive components. Hierarchical Bayesian Inference is adopted to facilitate the prediction of frequencies of disruptive events and estimate the entire system's failure rate. The outcome of this research enables design strategies to improve the reliability of autonomous ships and prevent Fatal Technical Failure during the operation.

However, besides the advantages, this transformation has brought cyber security gaps and threats which can be resulted in breakdowns in maritime transportation domain. Therefore, port and port facilities should be prepared for cyber threats through holistic risk assessment frameworks for developing proactive actions. Based on these facts, this study has proposed to apply an integrated cyber risk assessment method for a container port with a cyber-physical perspective through analyzing four exemplary cyber-attack scenarios. For each cyber-attack scenario, risk assessment methodology has been applied using integrated cyber security management approach by taking into account the cyber physical assets of the container port. Results show that for the specified cyber threats, the risks have been evaluated non acceptable. Mitigation strategies have also been presented briefly in conclusion.","https://www.proquest.com/docview/2503173045?accountid=44943&bdid=84593&_bd=HQSkoSzWM6tcb%2F%2FOR9kiJUQWIAk%3D","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cose.2021.102196"

"How big data enriches maritime research - a critical review of Automatic Identification System (AIS) data applications","","Yang, Dong; Wu, Lingxiao; Wang, Shuaian; Jia, Haiying; Li, Kevin X","Transport Reviews","Scholarly Journals","","39","6","2019-11-01","Nov 2019","755","","755-773","01441647","","","ENG","The information-rich vessel movement data provided by the Automatic Identification System (AIS) has gained much popularity over the past decade, during which the employment of satellite-based receivers has enabled wide coverage and improved data quality. The application of AIS data has developed from simply navigation-oriented research to now include trade flow estimation, emission accounting, and vessel performance monitoring. The AIS now provides high frequency, real-time positioning and sailing patterns for almost the whole world's commercial fleet, and therefore, in combination with supplementary databases and analyses, AIS data has arguably kickstarted the era of digitisation in the shipping industry. In this study, we conduct a comprehensive review of the literature regarding AIS applications by dividing it into three development stages, namely, basic application, extended application, and advanced application. Each stage contains two to three application fields, and in total we identified seven application fields, including (1) AIS data mining, (2) navigation safety, (3) ship behaviour analysis, (4) environmental evaluation, (5) trade analysis, (6) ship and port performance, and (7) Arctic shipping. We found that the original application of AIS data to navigation safety has, with the improvement of data accessibility, evolved into diverse applications in various directions. Moreover, we summarised the major methodologies in the literature into four categories, these being (1) data processing and mining, (2) index measurement, (3) causality analysis, and (4) operational research. Undoubtedly, the applications of AIS data will be further expanded in the foreseeable future. This will not only provide a more comprehensive understanding of voyage performance and allow researchers to examine shipping market dynamics from the micro level, but also the abundance of AIS data may also open up the rather opaque aspect of how shipping companies release information to external authorities, including the International Maritime Organization, port states, scientists and researchers. It is expected that more multi-disciplinary AIS studies will emerge in the coming years. We believe that this study will shed further light on the future development of AIS studies.","https://www.proquest.com/docview/2285045745?accountid=44943&bdid=84593&_bd=i%2BY3RDbM3Q140B8A4wBSUfxlBM4%3D","https://doi.org/10.1080/01441647.2019.1649315"

To this end, a decision framework is proposed based on a multi-criteria decision structure that incorporates AHP into VIKOR under Intuitionistic Fuzzy Theory. This integration presents different solutions and rankings based on different decision-making strategies and also captures uncertainty in the evaluation process. While Intuitionistic Fuzzy AHP calculates the importance weights of the proposed criteria indicated as scalability, privacy, interoperability, audit, latency, visibility, trust, and security, Fuzzy VIKOR ranks the logistics operations demonstrated as materials handling, warehousing, order processing, transportation, packaging, fleet management, labeling, vehicle routing and product returns management. The proposed decision framework was applied in a large-scale logistics company located in Turkey. The findings of this study suggest that while the most important criteria are security, visibility and audit, the most feasible logistics operations proved to be transportation, materials handling, warehousing, order processing and fleet management in a possible blockchain implementation. The decision framework in this study may enable decision makers to evaluate the feasibility of blockchain in logistics operations, which is one of the main research gaps in the current blockchain research.

Changing production patterns demanding greater end to end visibility by customers and accessibility to key inland population centers assume greater importance in the organization and design of transport resources and cargo flows. While synchronization of all aspects of the supply chain has become an operational necessity for firms, it is often held hostage to the efficiency of hinterland networks who must respond to a large group of stakeholders with sporadic coordination. This is particularly true when looking at the central US city and region of Chicago, a critical intermodal exchange point for truck, air and river barge traffic domestic and global, as well as a major central distribution location. This paper analyzes supply chain integration (SCI) efforts in the metropolitan Chicago region and considers efforts by public and private actors to collaborate for region-wide SCI improvements. Pareto analysis suggests that concentrated freight corridors exist, influencing freight planning for regional transportation networks more directly than diffused regional freight movements. If the corridor service becomes less responsive or congested the corridor will move to different end nodes within the broad region. Regional planning must thus address national, regional, and local moves. Private/public sector infrastructure firms should address functional cooperation on SCI by focusing on corridors as well as local improvements.","https://www.proquest.com/docview/1808734754?accountid=44943&bdid=84593&_bd=AzAxoxVMWFi2L%2Bbem5pdvGeEuhU%3D","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jtrangeo.2015.12.005"

Particular attention was paid to the variations in the performance of selected African countries in container ship calls, container throughput, and liner shipping connectivity between 2019 and 2020. Eighteen (18) African countries were selected from all the geographical regions of the continent based on data availability. Secondary data was drawn from records of maritime trade in the publications of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD) (2019, 2020, and 2021) as well as World Bank Development Indicators for the selected countries. Explorative data analysis was used to organize and present the data. Results showed that the North African region alone recorded an improved percentage of container ship calls in 2020 than in 2019. Results by individual countries showed that Ghana recorded the highest positive increase in ship calls in 2020 from her record in 2019. In addition, Morocco, recorded the highest container throughput in 2020 than the record in 2019 while all the countries exhibited a winding record of liner connectivity between the last quarter of 2019 through the last quarter of 2020. The study concluded that the disruption of maritime activity by the COVID-19 pandemic had a mixed impact on African countries' performance.

This article presents Obelisk, a scalable and multi‐tenant cloud‐based IoT integration platform used in the EU H2020 PortForward project. The landscape of IoT protocols being particularly fragmented, the first role of Obelisk is to provide uniform access to data originating from a myriad of devices and protocols. Interoperability is achieved through adapters that provide flexibility and evolvability in protocol and format mapping. Additionally, due to ports operating in a hub model with various interacting actors, a second role of Obelisk is to secure access to data. This is achieved through encryption and isolation for data transport and processing, respectively, while user access control is ensured through authentication and authorisation standards. Finally, as ports IoTisation will further evolve, a third need for Obelisk is to scale with the data volumes it must ingest and process. Platform scalability is achieved by means of a reactive micro‐services based design. Those three essential characteristics are detailed in this article with a specific focus on how to achieve IoT data platform scalability. By means of an air quality monitoring use‐case deployed in the city of Antwerp, the scalability of the platform is evaluated.

With the maritime industry being on the brink of a paradigm shift, not seen since the transition from sails to engines, regulations and training need to be implemented before the industry can progress towards autonomous vessel operations. Therefore, the maritime industry must implement methods and training regimes that seafarers can undertake to train skills such as situational awareness, to ensure that the human-automation relationship progresses smoothly and efficiently. The research reported within this paper aims to assess the elements required to aid the development of seafarers, in preparation for the inevitable change to autonomous maritime operations. A study was conducted which analysed the situational awareness of 14 junior navigational officers and 14 navigational officer cadets, by means of a bridge watch simulator and introducing the participants to an autopilot failure. The results of the study found a lack of system understanding, in the event of a fault, among the majority of participants. Additionally, even the participants displaying a satisfactory level of situational awareness required alarms before they could recognise a potential fault. Additionally, participants were given a survey which allowed the assessment of their personal views and opinions of autonomous operations.

This survey-based research analyzes the current and future competence needs of firms operating in maritime logistics and the maritime industry. The findings indicate that in both contexts, the increasing importance of various general competences is understood and the need is recognized in particular to improve those related to environmental regulation as well as technology and automation. Overall, the gap between current and desired levels of competence is expected to widen. In terms of education, this is likely to affect vocational training and university-level learning differently in that functional competences are emphasized more in the former and social and meta-competences in the latter.","https://www.proquest.com/docview/2500468315?accountid=44943&bdid=84593&_bd=E9ESyhie%2BpcvVtQkER%2B%2FdKFvgL8%3D","https://doi.org/10.1007/s13437-021-00228-0"

Although these projects have demonstrated the technological feasibility of this idea, the hypothesis that autonomous ships will be safer needs to be tested and safety constraints must be established. The main objective of this paper is to determine the hazards for the system as a function of the vessel's autonomy level. This is accomplished by implementing the System Theoretic Process Analysis (STPA) on specific levels of increasing autonomy, as described by the International Maritime Organization (IMO), where the human element is limited to remote monitoring and the on-board control system makes most of the decisions and takes most of the actions. STPA assumes that accidents are caused by unsafe interactions among system components, none of which may have failed. STPA presents an advantage over other hazard analysis tools, by being more flexible in terms of required information and by having a top-down functional model approach. The STPA's results are used to determine how hazard occurrence changes, considering the interactions among system components and hard to identify failure points. These results will be used to evaluate the hypothesis that autonomous shipping will be safer and potentially contribute to the ongoing discussion for the regulatory framework that must be implemented for autonomous shipping to become a large-scale reality.","https://www.proquest.com/docview/2466368212?accountid=44943&bdid=84593&_bd=OT5CLavzquZwHq8ya%2F5GnumGYHQ%3D","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ssci.2020.104919"

As container codes are the unique identifiers for shipping containers, recognizing these codes is an essential step to manage the containers and logistics. The conventional code localization methods can easily be interfered by varied noises and cannot identify the best regions for code recognition. In this article, we propose an adaptive deep learning framework for shipping container code localization and recognition. In the framework, the noisy text regions will be removed by an adaptive score aggregation (ASA) algorithm. The code region boundaries are identified by the average-to-maximum suppression range (AMSR) algorithm. Thus, the predicted locations can be adjusted within this range to fit the code recognition model to achieve higher accuracy. The experimental results on the comparative study with the state-of-the-art models, including EAST, PSENet, GCRNN, and MaskTextSpotter, demonstrated that the proposed framework achieved better localization performance and obtained 93.33% recognition accuracy. The processing speed reaches 1.13 frames/s, which is sufficient to meet the operational requirements.

The strategic development of seaport terminals, responding to the need for closer integration into supply chains, invites a more detailed examination of the influence of the supply chain structures on seaport performance. Therefore, this paper aims to investigate the effects of supply chain structures, especially the degree of integration of seaports into supply chains, on seaport performance. Design/methodology/approach - The parameters for a structural equation model were identified in the first instance from the supply chain and seaport operations and management literature. The structural equation model itself was then devised, and subsequently refined, using data from Korean seaport terminal operators, shipping companies and freight forwarding companies. The structural equation model was used to assess the level of supply chain integration of seaports and the relationship to port performance. Findings - The results indicate that the integration of seaports into supply chains has a positive impact on both the effectiveness and the efficiency of seaport performance. In addition, antecedents to seaport supply chain integration are identified; these suggest that a strong orientation to supply chain integration within a port operating company enables the company to adopt and implement a strategy that integrates functions within the port and with other upstream and downstream organisations. Research limitations/implications - As the field data were geographically limited to one country, extending the findings of this study to other geographical areas may not be possible, although the approach taken, using the structural equation modelling technique, should be transferrable elsewhere. Cross-validation of the model would widen its applicability to other areas. The paper provides a framework that allows other researchers to examine the level of integration of ports into supply chains. Practical implications - The potential benefits of closer integration of seaports into supply chains are shown with supply chain integration having a positive effect on port performance. Seaports which do not integrate with their supply chains have a lower level of performance. Thus, enhanced port performance accruing from closer integration would have positive implications both for port and terminal managers and for other supply chain participants. Originality/value - This study, for the first time, empirically examines the impact of the integration into supply chains of seaports on their performance. This is achieved by the development of a structural equation model which is then tested in the field, thus extending the existing literature which is largely conceptual or descriptive.","https://www.proquest.com/docview/1559647919?accountid=44943&bdid=84593&_bd=2BMzNbFtxFbnX5HxLiYVrDWt3t4%3D","https://doi.org/10.1108/SCM-09-2011-0264"

Considering that the dimensions of the radar sensors deployment problem increase with the increasing number of radars deployed and that the strength of the monkey algorithm is that it avoids the “dimension disaster,”this algorithm is introduced to solve the optimization problem. Some improvements are made based on the shortcomings of the traditional monkey algorithm. Adaptive climbing steps are used in the climbing process to enhance its local search capabilities, a tent function is used to balance the search accuracy and search time in the overlooking process and the jumping process, and a semi-group execution strategy is adopted for the above two processes. To improve the search accuracy, the learning factor and the Euclidean distance are introduced into the looping process, which improves the optimization ability and avoids the individual homoplasy. Therefore, the improved chaotic self-adapting monkey algorithm (ICSAMA) is proposed and abbreviated to ICSAMA. The simulation results show that the improved chaotic adaptive monkey algorithm is better than the monkey algorithm regarding the convergence precision and convergence rate. Finally, a mathematical model of radar deployment is established based on the volume of airspace coverage. Three simulation experiments are designed by using different conditions and scenarios, such as air defense, maritime combat, and trajectory planning, and an emphasis is placed on describing the applications of ICSAMA. The results show that ICSAMA can effectively solve the problem of radar deployment and provide technical support for the site selection of new observation and communication posts, deployment of maneuverable radar stations, and track planning of fleets.","https://www.proquest.com/docview/2455922794?accountid=44943&bdid=84593&_bd=08OGQ8x6SJGMRbN2mO8GmPGNDgo%3D","https://doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2018.2869632"

Millions of maritime vessels operate without the means for their positions to be independently tracked, presenting a problem for safety and security of life at sea. To date, visible wavelength imaging from space has been of limited use for vessel detection and tracking due to poor area coverage provided by individual satellites. This situation is now changing. We present a survey of currently operating spacecraft carrying electro-optical imagers offering adequate imaging resolution and commercial data availability. We model the coverage provided by 54 satellites and 85 sensors over a target area to assess the value of these assets for space-based maritime domain awareness. The results show that useful levels of coverage can now be obtained through the collective observations of existing spacecraft, although on-board resources will limit the amount of imagery that can be acquired. The launch of large numbers of high-resolution imaging nanosatellites produced by private companies will improve this coverage, and the increasing capability of small satellite platforms offers the possibility of a dedicated Electro-Optical Space-Based Maritime Domain Awareness constellation that can realise the full benefit of the concept.

Regardless of the presence of crew members on board, both manned and autonomous ships should follow clear guidelines (no matter as bridge procedures or algorithms). To date, many safety indicators, especially in collision avoidance have been proposed. One of such parameters commonly used in day-to-day navigation but usually omitted by researchers is Bow Crossing Range (BCR). Therefore, this paper aims to investigate, what are typical, empirical values of BCR during routine operations of merchant ships, as well as investigate what factors impact this indicator and to what extent. To this end, a ten-year big dataset of real maritime traffic obtained from the Automatic Identification System (AIS) was used to provide statistical and spatiotemporal analyses. The results indicate that BCR is strongly related to the type of navigational area (open sea or restricted waters) but not with the dimensions or speed of ships. Among analyzed vessel types, passenger ships were noted as vessels that cross other bows at the closes ranges. Results of this study may be found interesting by fleet managers and developers of Maritime Autonomous Surface Ships (MASS). The former could utilize the results to provide revised operational guidelines for deck officers while the latter - propose an early-detection warning system based on empirical data for prospective MASS.","https://www.proquest.com/docview/2639034429?accountid=44943&bdid=84593&_bd=%2Bgty7y1yJ8zZL1awjj8cUj%2FtvKU%3D","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ress.2021.108311"

These errors often cause large relative errors at a pixel and cause pixelization or ""speckling"" across the image, which is particularly obvious in the SeaWiFS chlorophyll standard product. Using simulations and current SeaWiFS algorithms, we show the effect of digitization-noise errors on the SeaWiFS ocean-color data products. It is found that the SeaWiFS mission goals, namely to estimate water-leaving radiances to within plus or minus 5% and chlorophyll-a concentrations to within plus or minus 35% for Case I waters, cannot always be met. For maritime aerosol conditions the errors in the estimated chlorophyll concentrations over oligotrophic waters can easily reach plus or minus 60% and the absolute values over adjacent pixels can vary 2-3 fold. Several schemes can be used to reduce this type of error, among which the spatial smoothing of the atmospheric-correction bands is recommended. This is because the errors in those bands are propagated and exaggerated to the visible bands and to the chlorophyll product through the atmospheric-correction process. The smoothing scheme, however, will cause more pixels to be discarded over cloud edges. Ultimately, a significant increase in both digitization bits and sensitivity is essential to achieve the stated mission goals. Such improved specifications are available on MODIS.","https://www.proquest.com/docview/18563448?accountid=44943&bdid=84593&_bd=7h2wKTiH9Zxcrp95f1TBnsG3Ga8%3D",""

Changing production patterns demanding greater end to end visibility by customers and accessibility to key inland population centers assume greater importance in the organization and design of transport resources and cargo flows. While synchronization of all aspects of the supply chain has become an operational necessity for firms, it is often held hostage to the efficiency of hinterland networks who must respond to a large group of stakeholders with sporadic coordination. This is particularly true when looking at the central US city and region of Chicago, a critical intermodal exchange point for truck, air and river barge traffic domestic and global, as well as a major central distribution location. This paper analyzes supply chain integration (SCI) efforts in the metropolitan Chicago region and considers efforts by public and private actors to collaborate for region-wide SCI improvements. Pareto analysis suggests that concentrated freight corridors exist, influencing freight planning for regional transportation networks more directly than diffused regional freight movements. If the corridor service becomes less responsive or congested the corridor will move to different end nodes within the broad region. Regional planning must thus address national, regional, and local moves. Private/public sector infrastructure firms should address functional cooperation on SCI by focusing on corridors as well as local improvements.","https://www.proquest.com/docview/1825473304?accountid=44943&bdid=84593&_bd=6D1LbIgz6Eyr52JQyEeoK6hAbA0%3D","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jtrangeo.2015.12.005"

Through the review of various international journals, the development of Autonomy and Technology are explored and analysed. Owing to the practical approach of this paper, a qualitative research method is used with collecting and analysing information.FindingsThe findings of this paper are as follows: it brings out the importance on the potentials of unmanned vessels and its competitive advantages over existing cargo ships. Besides its contribution to reduce fatigue and workload of navigating officers, the improvement of navigational safety by eliminating human errors and reduction of harmful exhaust emission can make shipping safer and more sustainable. However, as the technology is still under development, it is too early for a final evaluation.

In this model, buyers order products and services directly from the manufacturer over the Internet through the intermediary of a drop shipper who ensures the easiest and fastest delivery. Drop shipper is a type of e-commerce entrepreneur that offers goods using online logistics infrastructure to ensure direct physical delivery from the manufacturer to the retailer or customer. This includes drop shipping as a business model to Industry 4.0 (i.e. the digital economy). This paper elaborates how a particular e-commerce model affects the development and improvement of global supply chains. Aim of this paper is to research how entrepreneur can lower its costs along drop shipping supply chain by managing inventory ratios or cost of stock. This enables drop shipping to greatly facilitate market access for cash-strapped entrepreneurs. We also conducted a simulation of optimized drop shipping process to show that there is a constant adaptability for entrepreneurs using drop shipping, especially among small and medium enterprises (SMEs). The timeliness of drop shipping is that it has facilitated as a global delivery solution in relation to the coronavirus disease pandemic (COVID-19). Moreover, drop shipping is based on a Activity-Based Costing (ABC model) whose quantitative efficiency has been proven by scientific analysis and research results. Finally, the legal aspects of drop shipping are given importance in the situation of COVID-19 which had a crucial impact on international trade in 2020, especially in predicting shortterm trade trends. Due to this within this paper we also examined the effects of the ˝coronavirus˝ on global e-commerce.

We propose low-cost, lightweight methods for near-real-time estimation of mean catchment-wide SWE using existing infrastructure, wireless sensor networks, and machine learning algorithms. Because snowpack distribution is highly nonlinear, we focus on Genetic Programming (GP), a nonlinear, white-box, inductive machine learning algorithm. Because we did not have access to near-real-time catchment-scale SWE data, we used available data as ground truth for machine learning in a set of experiments that are successive approximations of our goal of catchment-wide SWE estimation. First, we used a history of maritime snowpack data collected by manual snow courses. Second, we used distributed snow depth (HS) data collected automatically by wireless sensor networks. We compared the performance of GP against linear regression (LR), binary regression trees (BT), and a widely used basic method (BM) that naively assumes non-variable snowpack. In the first experiment set, GP and LR models predicted SWE with lower error than BM.

Different utility-driven operations models are built to highlight the values of blockchain technology for port logistics capability, and to reveal the equilibria under the optimal strategies and equilibrium strategies. It is noticed that the relationship between the unit net benefit and unit operations cost brought out by blockchain technology is a key factor determining whether the blockchain technology is applicable. When the unit operations cost is lower than unit net benefit, and the setup cost is high, there is a win-win situation for two ports to apply traditional technology.

We describe a case study performed for the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to develop a prototype risk prediction system to provide early alerts of elevated risk levels to vessel traffic managers and operators in the Lower Mississippi River, the second largest port of entry in the United States. Integrating incident and accident data from the USCG with environmental and traffic data sources, we tested existing machine learning algorithms in their predictive ability. We found poor accident prediction accuracy in cross‐validation using the traditional measures of precision and sensitivity. In this specific operational context, however, such single‐class accuracy metrics can be misleading. We define action precision and action sensitivity metrics that measure the accuracy of predictions in engendering the correct behavioral response (actions) among vessel operators, rather than getting the specific event classification correct. We use these operationally appropriate measures for maritime risk prediction to choose an algorithm for our prototype system. While the traditional metrics indicated that none of the algorithms would perform sufficiently well to use in the early warning system, the modified metrics show that the top performing algorithm will perform well in this operational context.","https://www.proquest.com/docview/2633831527?accountid=44943&bdid=84593&_bd=JmvKgdMZnZw2RsrtTIxbRxRkwug%3D","https://doi.org/10.1111/poms.13581"

Risk analysis and assessment (RAA) is, therefore, a growing research focus on container shipping policy and management. Currently, it is challenging to grasp a state-of-the-art understanding of the field due to the fragmentation of the central concepts and overlapping taxonomies. This critical review paper clearly indicates this fragmentation by an overarching framework to cover both CSO and RAA aspects. The results revealed the attention toward ports and container shipping companies as the primary subjects of research; and Asia-Pacific and Europe as the fruitful regions of empirical studies. Thirty-five typical information, physical, and financial risks were identified in various CSOs. Regarding the CSO aspect, besides more empirical applications of RAA models, approaches and methods to support the collaborative mitigation and prevention efforts are considered critical tasks of the field, especially in the upcoming era of digitalization in container shipping. Regarding the RAA aspect, the establishment of a common framework that acknowledges uncertainty as a core component of risk is necessary to support the CSO aspect in dealing with emerging issues.","https://www.proquest.com/docview/2654906479?accountid=44943&bdid=84593&_bd=QtguFzE9%2FykBfD%2Bn9%2FI7L2PQdcs%3D","https://doi.org/10.1080/03088839.2021.1875142"

The European Commission's Joint Research Centre (JRC) has developed an in-house data collection, data analysis and data visualiztion facility, known as the Blue Hub. The Blue Hub operates as a research and development platform for integrated maritime surveillance and maritime situational awareness. It has global coverage and has been applied, for example, to support counter-piracy around Africa, to investigate fishing activity and to monitor the growing ship traffic in the Arctic. In order to improve maritime awareness and support risk assessment, the JRC has started to integrate data from the marine and atmosheric science community. In particular the JRC is interested in using forecasts from operational ocean models and weather models. For the Blue Hub a new type of data server, called ERDDAP, that performs message brokering and data mediation has become an essential tool for the accessing of ocean forecast data as quickly as possible in easy to use formats. NOAA (National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration of the USA) is making global oceanography and weather data available through the Environmental Research Division's Data Access Program (ERDDAP) data broker. ERDDAP provides RESTful machine to machine communication, data brokering and data mediation by converting data to a number of standard and developer friendly formats, including some Open Geospatial Consortium formats. In this paper, we demonstrate how data brokering and mediation is making complex scientific data accessible.

These converging profit‐driven and ethical projects collectively support a technocratic language ideology. It locates risks to the supply chain in presumptions of miscommunications caused by the lack of English‐language use and unsociability caused by the lack of convivial talk among seafarers for channeling information about these risks.

Therefore, the number of voyages take place in the seas is increasing and more intensive maritime traffic occurs in narrow channels. One of the difficult and dense seaways in the world is the Istanbul Strait, which is one of the most important strategical channels that connects the Black Sea and the Marmara Sea. Every year many marine vessels navigate in this route and carry dangerous cargos for human health and environment. Thus, ensuring safe navigation in the Strait is an important subject due to prevent a marine accident, save human health, and protect the environment from any disaster. In this study, meteorological knowledge, one of the important factors affecting safe navigation, is provided from a local weather station. The visibility during the passage in the Strait has estimated with various machine learning methods based on wind speed/direction, humidity, pressure, time indicators. To determine the relationship between the variables more clearly, a correlation matrix was created firstly. Different error metrics have used for accuracy and reliability of the predictions.

AVs are envisaged to evolve to a service rather than a product in the future. To provide best user experience of such services, three primary factors, namely, waiting time, travel time, and supply of AV services, are taken into consideration in a multiobjective optimization. Conventional optimization of services relies on traffic flow analysis over a queuing network model. However, due to the mobility of vehicles and the transfer uncertainty of road networks, the queuing network analysis is too complicated and practically intractable. For accuracy and convenient processing, network calculus (NC) is extended to model the queueing problem in this paper. The optimal number of available AVs can be identified by guaranteeing the waiting time of customers. The satisfaction of AV services can be viewed as a supply and demand problem, and optimized by bipartite graph matching. In order to reduce the average travel time, especially for rush hours with heavy traffic, we further propose a new online AVs fleet management scheme with congestion control for smart cities. It is shown that the intelligent management of AV fleet can be efficiently achieved, outperforming the cases of traditional vehicles. NC-assisted AI enables an efficient intelligent transportation paradigm in smart cities, while achieving substantial energy saving.","https://www.proquest.com/docview/2222205932?accountid=44943&bdid=84593&_bd=vmUGE2iwFI4QPuJBVBtV%2B7u%2FzmM%3D","https://doi.org/10.1109/JIOT.2018.2872442"

It enables novel Product-Service Systems (PSS) that transform customer/supplier relationships and introduces new value propositions. However, while opportunities for novel types of PSS arise, it is not clear how digitization and the institutionalisation of digital capabilities, particularly within the customer organisations, may affect implementation of PSS, potentially leading to transformational changes in the customer organisation. This paper examines one such potential transformational change from three complementary viewpoints – the resource based, the dynamic, and the relational viewpoint. It does so through action research study in the context of the maritime industry, which is particularly attractive for PSS offerings. The research methodology comprised a two-step action research process, focusing on both digitization and PSS development and implementation. The main findings are that rather than facilitating procurement to co-development of PSS, institutionalisation of digital capabilities facilitated development of PSS by stakeholders internal to the company, and strategic co-development with external stakeholders. The new digital capabilities circumvented cost barriers associated with the procurement of services from external stakeholders, supported process standardisation - to the expense of process innovation-, and transformed the network that delivered PSS by closing opportunity gaps for externally procured services. Furthermore, the uptake of digital capabilities highlighted the importance of cost estimation in making the customer more responsive to threats and opportunities.","https://www.proquest.com/docview/2010207621?accountid=44943&bdid=84593&_bd=uVpo5bNlddEUdkQwX5x62ZHYbTU%3D","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jclepro.2017.08.019"

It is very important for China’s economic development and national defense construction to improve the level of tropical cyclone research and prediction. In recent years, the objective prediction level of tropical cyclone has been greatly improved, but the improvement of intensity prediction is relatively small. The uncertainty of long-term change prediction such as generation frequency is still great, which is still the focus of scholars. In a complex environment, it is very challenging to fully understand the potential characteristics of the transaction, so as to design the best mechanism to effectively obtain benefits from the transaction. In this paper, the random forest algorithm is used to study the intensity prediction of tropical cyclone with the same data, so as to investigate the applicability of the machine learning method and try to improve the numerical prediction results. It is found that the machine learning method of random forest has better prediction ability for tropical cyclone intensity, which is better than GEFs results.

Low-cost IoT can be implemented in medium-scale operations to automate the collection of process management information that is currently measured manually, replicating part of the results delivered by commercial Fleet Management Systems (FMSs) such as the calculations of the number of truck cycles per shift, the shovel loading time, truck and shovel positioning, tonnes moved per day, truck speed and average fleet efficiency. The process of developing mining benches can also be monitored. By monitoring these tasks, FMSs in the mining industry allow mine operators to maximise productivity, reduce the number of equipment required to accomplish production targets, minimise material re-handling, supply the plant as planned and meet ore blending objectives for better metallurgical recoveries. In the case of large-scale mines, these mining operations are prepared to invest in the high cost of a typical FMS (of the order of $100,000/month depending on fleet size) because they enable mine operators to ensure that their capital-intensive fleets operate at peak productivity, generating maximum return on investment. By contrast, many medium-scale mines cannot afford the installation and ongoing costs associated with a commercial FMS. Medium-scale mines typically have low capitalization, rented mining fleet and are run on a day-to-day basis, with staff being employed or laid off on an almost continuous basis. The emergence of low-cost IoT promises widespread and access to sensors and data that can be used for operational decision-making. This paper presents a trial of a low-cost, under $100, IoT-based Fleet Information System (FIS). The system does not attempt to replicate the functionality of a full FMS but delivers key management information to the mine operators while having low capital and running costs and no requirement for IT or technical skills for installation or maintenance. In a test case in Chile, the FIS was used to inform operational management changes that resulted in a reduction of loading time, optimisation of mining truck routes and truck speed control for better safety without an increase in the mining cost. The low cost of the solution allows medium-scale mines access to tools that can enable them to mirror the performance improvements of their bigger competitors. For medium-scale mines, that means longer life-of-mine, more local employment and a longer positive impact in the community.","https://www.proquest.com/docview/2580731025?accountid=44943&bdid=84593&_bd=foTJjPU9vZzY640htQ01B8aaPTQ%3D","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.autcon.2021.103918"

However, their new systems and technology need thorough verifications to identify unintended components of risk. The interaction between MASS cyber-physical systems and the existing regulatory framework is currently unpredictable; AI-powered intelligent situation awareness and autonomous navigation algorithms must safely and efficiently adhere to the regulations which are only designed for human interpretation without MASSs consideration. This paper contributes to algorithmic regulations and particularly algorithmic COLREGs in real-world MASS applications. It focuses on codifying COLREGs into a machine-executable system applicable to MASSs. This fullest COLREGs evaluation is modelled in form of a fuzzy expert system based on ordinary seamanship practice. The full input space spans 21 features derived from maneuverability-dependent risk, AIS traffic data, vessel information, maps and nautical charts, water-depth, visibility, and sea conditions. The model assesses pairwise vessel encounters over the full time-window of a situation from entrance to exit. 42 fuzzy rules are designed in 6 criteria that represent COLREGs Rules 2–19 and model their logical connections, priorities, and relationships. This algorithmic COLREGs form satisfies the crucial needs in simulation, collision-avoidance, complexity monitoring, and compliance quantification in MASS applications. The fullest COLREGs evaluation model is verified on a large database of historical encounters using real data from multiple sources.","https://www.proquest.com/docview/2723902270?accountid=44943&bdid=84593&_bd=8L1U3PhL5OTzQwkkBp5r5oTMCaQ%3D","https://doi.org/10.1109/TITS.2022.3151826"
"Extending On-Chain Trust to Off-Chain – Trustworthy Blockchain Data Collection Using Trusted Execution Environment (TEE)","","Liu, Chunchi; Guo, Hechuan; Xu, Minghui; Wang, Shengling; Yu, Dongxiao; Yu, Jiguo; Cheng, Xiuzhen","IEEE Transactions on Computers","Scholarly Journals","","71","12","2022-01-01","2022","3268","","3268-3280","00189340","","","ENG","Blockchain creates a secure environment on top of strict cryptographic assumptions and rigorous security proofs. It permits on-chain interactions to achieve trustworthy properties such as traceability, transparency, and accountability. However, current blockchain trustworthiness is only confined to on-chain, creating a “trust gap” to the physical, off-chain environment. This is due to the lack of a scheme that can truthfully reflect the physical world in a real-time and consistent manner. Such an absence hinders further blockchain applications in the physical world, especially for the security-sensitive ones. In this paper, we propose a framework to extend blockchain trust from on-chain to off-chain, and take trustworthy vaccine tracing as an example scheme. Our scheme consists of 1) a Trusted Execution Environment (TEE)-enabled trusted environment monitoring system built with the Arm Cortex-M33 microcontroller that continuously senses the inside of a vaccine box through trusted sensors and generates anti-forgery data; and 2) a consistency protocol to upload the environment status data from the TEE system to blockchain in a truthful, real-time consistent, continuous and fault-tolerant fashion. Our security analysis indicates that no adversary can tamper with the vaccine in any way without being captured. We carry out an experiment to record the internal status of a vaccine shipping box during transportation, and the results indicate that the proposed system incurs an average latency of 84 ms in local sensing and processing followed by an average latency of 130 ms to have the sensed data transmitted to and been available in the blockchain.","https://www.proquest.com/docview/2736890938?accountid=44943&bdid=84593&_bd=obgOT%2BadTnwgAILNfFT86QXsT7s%3D","https://doi.org/10.1109/TC.2022.3148379"

Due to the safety‐critical nature of ships, software quality assurance (SQA) has become an essential prerequisite for such development.ObjectiveBased on the unique characteristics of the maritime domain, the purpose of this study was to achieve effective SQA resource allocation to reduce post‐release quality costs.MethodSoftware defect prediction (SDP) is employed to predict defects in newly developed software based on models trained with past software defects and to update information using machine learning. This study demonstrated that just‐in‐time SDP is applicable to maritime domain practice and can reduce post‐release quality costs via combination with an estimation model, qCOPLIMO.ResultsUsing real‐world datasets collected from the maritime industry, performance and cost‐benefit analyses of SDP were performed. A successful model was obtained that meets the performance criterion of 0.75 in within‐project defect prediction (WPDP) but not cross‐project defect prediction (CPDP). In addition, the cost‐benefit analysis results showed that 20% effort enables the detection of 56% of defects on average and that the post‐release quality cost can be reduced by 37.3% in the maritime domain.ConclusionSDP can be successfully applied to the maritime domain. Further, it is desirable to utilize WPDP instead of CPDP once minimum high‐quality commits are available that can be identified as defective or not. Finally, SDP can help reduce review effort and post‐release quality costs.","https://www.proquest.com/docview/2496997161?accountid=44943&bdid=84593&_bd=Je5Zu6nrCgIJFSgO5R9fkWLc1oM%3D","https://doi.org/10.1002/spe.2927"

The retailer fulfills cross‐border orders using online platforms, but faces inventory problems in its overseas warehouses, owing to operational complexities, such as extensive product offerings, high demand risks, and tax risks in cross‐border trade. Traditional approaches (e.g., model‐driven approaches) often fail to provide effective solutions. Therefore, this study proposes a new data‐driven approach to manage inventory in overseas warehouses.Methodology: A two‐stage predictive analytics approach is implemented, as follows: (i) all items are classified into one of two classes, where A‐items are profitable to store in overseas warehouses, but B‐items are not; (ii) the demand levels of SKUs of A‐items are predicted. In the subsequent prescriptive analytics, models are proposed for optimizing inventory decisions related to A‐items. These include a deterministic model that uses the predicted demand as the true demand, and a stochastic model that treats the true demand as a random variable.Results: (i) Using a variety of machine learning techniques in the predictive analytics phase, we find the random forest outperforms other methods. (ii) The deterministic model can be solved as a linear program, and the stochastic model with maximum entropy distributions can be solved using Karush–Kuhn–Tucker conditions. (iii) An application of our results shows that the predictive classification reduces costs (an average cost reduction of up to 20%) by avoid shipping unprofitable items to overseas warehouses. Furthermore, the stochastic model provides near‐optimal solutions (the smallest performance loss is just 0.00%).","https://www.proquest.com/docview/2470158949?accountid=44943&bdid=84593&_bd=Z1B%2F2A0zQUFV83Ud32isgl%2F5Dzs%3D","https://doi.org/10.1111/deci.12429"

I examine two cases where efforts are made to digitalize container shipping workflows: a set of global standards for shipping data and a new “sustainable” platform for streamlining the movement of ships through port. In both cases, conceptions and practices of practicality shape digital infrastructures in ways that help maintain the uneven distribution of technology, goods, and capacities in times of otherwise drastic change. Shipping industry publicity tends to emphasize the newness of objects like self-driving cars, but much of the work of digitalizing occurs through the extensive, and comparatively invisible, data infrastructures that are being developed to digitalize processes for displacing goods. Through an analysis of how new digital infrastructures are being implemented, I argue that the narrow range of what is made to be practical under capitalism is reproduced through the ways in which shipping is being digitized. I seek to understand one key aspect of practicality in particular: efforts to maintain the displacement of certain forms of politics from logistics. Such efforts reproduce logistics as a technocratic science while marking, for example, labor and antiracist politics as outside the bounds of consideration. Logistical agents are thus shaping digitalization into a process that is implemented only insofar as it reproduces existing injustice.","https://www.proquest.com/docview/2641215164?accountid=44943&bdid=84593&_bd=QHS5HDTvizukG%2BvApD8t18hHsTw%3D","https://doi.org/10.1080/24694452.2021.2020085"

The amount of the atmospheric water vapor is being described by the atmospheric specific humidity. The values of the spectral optical atmospheric thickness are being regressed with the simultaneous values of the atmospheric specific humidity and on the wavelength of the spectral solar irradiation, during the occurrence of continental and maritime air masses. The data analysis indicates the decrease of spectral optical atmospheric thickness with increase of the wavelength of the solar beam irradiation and, mainly, the major role of the amount of atmospheric water vapor on the spectral optical atmospheric thickness due to continental or maritime aerosols. The water vapor interaction with the particles of the insoluble continental dust results to the partial wetting and growing of the dust particles. In the atmospheric specific humidity minimum, which is observed in the dry and cold season, the spectral optical atmospheric thickness is minimized with the prevalence of continental air mass. In the atmospheric specific humidity maximum, which is observed in the wet and warm season, the spectral optical atmospheric thickness is maximized with the continental air mass prevalence, too. The water vapor interaction with the soluble sea-salt crystals of maritime aerosol is opposite from this with the insoluble continental dust and results in the complete dissolution of the sea- salt crystals in the wet season. During the presence of maritime air masses, the included sea-salt aerosols are dissolved by the atmospheric water vapor and the spectral optical atmospheric thickness takes intermediate values in the near violet and visible spectral regions of the solar spectrum. The observational data analysis results in two families of regression curves of the spectral optical atmospheric thickness with the atmospheric specific humidity, one corresponding to the continental and one to the maritime aerosol. The aim of this work is the explanation of the physical phenomenon of the hot sunrays during some winter days and of the weak sunrays during summer days.","https://www.proquest.com/docview/17193636?accountid=44943&bdid=84593&_bd=7RWsnwk1XGkPjgubvWNuwDIF1OU%3D","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.atmosres.2005.02.004"

Recent advancements in shipbuilding, equipment for robotised ships, the high quality of shipboard game plans, the cost of overhauling, dependability, the fixing of the shipboard equipment and the requesting of the safe shipping and environmental protection, requires constant information on recent equipment and programming for computational intelligence by marine officers. We carry out an analysis to determine which methods of artificial intelligence can allow us to eliminate human subjectivity and uncertainty from real navigational situations involving manoeuvring decisions made by marine officers. Trainees learn by using computer simulation methods to calculate the optimal safe traverse of the ship in the event of a possible collision with other ships, which are mapped using neural networks that take into consideration the subjectivity of the navigator. The game-optimal safe trajectory for the ship also considers the uncertainty in the navigational situation, which is measured in terms of the risk of collision. The use of artificial intelligence methods in the final stage of training on ship automation can improve the practical education of marine officers and allow for safer and more effective ship operation.","https://www.proquest.com/docview/2519949008?accountid=44943&bdid=84593&_bd=H7biP%2BY3FURBNRqXlZ%2FAgnbwJK0%3D","https://doi.org/10.2478/pomr-2021-0015"

As one of the key technologies in the IoT, machine-type communication (MTC) has been considered to support devices’ connectivity. In the MTC, random access is introduced for devices to share a common access channel during the packet transmission with low signaling overhead. However, the collision caused by the presence of multiple devices is inevitable. Since maritime sensors have limited energy sources, in this article, we propose a relay-aided random access (RARA) scheme for the smart ocean, where retransmissions are carried out by maritime buoys with the relay function, to deal with collisions. In the RARA scheme, a base station (BS) is able to recover multiple collided signal packets simultaneously by using multiuser detection with multiple copies of collided signals forwarded by buoy nodes. As a result, our proposed scheme becomes energy efficient and reliable to be suitable for the smart ocean. Theoretical and simulation results show that a high throughput and a low outage probability can be achieved with a large number of buoy nodes.","https://www.proquest.com/docview/2449951561?accountid=44943&bdid=84593&_bd=Nx6XUi2AxJ2nzc7BCQLOpHcM69I%3D","https://doi.org/10.1109/JIOT.2020.2990164"

In the development of GeMASS, a machine learning approach was applied to discover knowledge that is applicable in characterizing maritime security threats. Such knowledge is often implicit in datasets and difficult to discover by human analysts. As the knowledge relevant to maritime security may vary from time to time, GeMASS was specified to learn from streaming data and to generate up-to-date knowledge in a dynamic fashion. Based on the knowledge discovered, the system functions to screen vessels for anomalies in real-time. Traditionally in maritime security studies, datasets that are applied as knowledge sources are related to vessels' geographical and movement information.

Because snowpack distribution is highly nonlinear, we focus on Genetic Programming (GP), a nonlinear, white-box, inductive machine learning algorithm. Because we did not have access to near-real-time catchment-scale SWE data, we used available data as ground truth for machine learning in a set of experiments that are successive approximations of our goal of catchment-wide SWE estimation. First, we used a history of maritime snowpack data collected by manual snow courses. Second, we used distributed snow depth (HS) data collected automatically by wireless sensor networks. We compared the performance of GP against linear regression (LR), binary regression trees (BT), and a widely used basic method (BM) that naively assumes non-variable snowpack.

Such networks are composed of a number of mobile wireless nodes typical of MANETs, but also have fixed (satellite) links and are continuously powered as is typical of fixed networks. Combined, these characteristics provide unique challenges not conducive to the use of existing MANET or fixed network management techniques. Since maritime units also operate in a low-bandwidth environment with varying communications capabilities, the efficiency of network management services is critical. Similarly, the lack of power constraints and slower mobility require a less dynamic solution than that required for MANETs. This article provides an overview of the maritime network management problem space including two key management opportunities provided by such an environment. The first opportunity is in automation. Maritime networks are subject to changing operational requirements, while at the same time suffering from limited availability of skilled network operators. To rapidly respond to faults and changes in performance needs, we propose the use of a serviceoriented policy-based management architecture on which a wide variety of management services can be rapidly deployed. The second key management opportunity is resource optimization. We suggest several management services that can be used to support traffic engineering.

Yet their tangled cyber-physical-social interactions and new emerging properties induce questions regarding their liability and trustworthiness. Digital simulations and sea trials are launched to assure the safety requirements and social expectations are met a priori. This paper presents the design of realistic testbed scenarios from huge historical data through a high-performance computational method to recommend a complete set of navigation scenarios for autonomy tests. The developed approach integrates traffic big data from Automatic Identification System (AIS) with high-resolution digital maps, vessel information registry, and digital nautical charts. All historical vessel-to-ground and vessel-to-vessel interactions are efficiently analyzed through a hierarchical method for collision and grounding conflicts assessment with a 15-minutes prediction horizon. Relative risk is evaluated accurately over full periods of predicted close-quarters situations subject to physical limits and sea-room availability for evasive maneuverers under COLREG rules and traffic separation schemes. Spatial dependencies among multiple conflicts define risky momentary traffic situations modelled through directed graph representation of nested interactions. Their temporal dependencies describe navigation scenarios through dynamic co-behaviors between multiple participating vessels over a period of time. Finally, we analyze negative/positive actions that increase/decrease the complexity. The presented algorithms are computationally very efficient, they scale to several (country*year)s where millions of scenarios are extracted, classified, and scored by their relative risk, complexity, and likelihood for firm post-test conclusions.","https://www.proquest.com/docview/2602792788?accountid=44943&bdid=84593&_bd=IIE8b45%2FCxYlclovCZL1%2BBH1dPg%3D","https://doi.org/10.1109/TITS.2021.3095547"

In this article, we propose a novel adaptive privacy-preserving federated learning approach, named AdaPFL, for fault diagnosis in IoS, which can organize different shipping agents to collaboratively develop a model by sharing model parameters with no risk of data leakage. First, we use two common tasks as examples to demonstrate that a small part of the model parameters might reveal the shipping agents’ raw information. Based on this, the Paillier-based communication scheme is designed to preserve the raw information of the shipping agents. Furthermore, to deal with the harsh marine environment, a control algorithm is proposed to adaptively change the model aggregation interval during the training process for reducing cryptography computation and communication costs.

The strategic development of seaport terminals, responding to the need for closer integration into supply chains, invites a more detailed examination of the influence of the supply chain structures on seaport performance. Therefore, this paper aims to investigate the effects of supply chain structures, especially the degree of integration of seaports into supply chains, on seaport performance. Design/methodology/approach - The parameters for a structural equation model were identified in the first instance from the supply chain and seaport operations and management literature. The structural equation model itself was then devised, and subsequently refined, using data from Korean seaport terminal operators, shipping companies and freight forwarding companies. The structural equation model was used to assess the level of supply chain integration of seaports and the relationship to port performance. Findings - The results indicate that the integration of seaports into supply chains has a positive impact on both the effectiveness and the efficiency of seaport performance. In addition, antecedents to seaport supply chain integration are identified; these suggest that a strong orientation to supply chain integration within a port operating company enables the company to adopt and implement a strategy that integrates functions within the port and with other upstream and downstream organisations. Research limitations/implications - As the field data were geographically limited to one country, extending the findings of this study to other geographical areas may not be possible, although the approach taken, using the structural equation modelling technique, should be transferrable elsewhere. Cross-validation of the model would widen its applicability to other areas. The paper provides a framework that allows other researchers to examine the level of integration of ports into supply chains. Practical implications - The potential benefits of closer integration of seaports into supply chains are shown with supply chain integration having a positive effect on port performance. Seaports which do not integrate with their supply chains have a lower level of performance. Thus, enhanced port performance accruing from closer integration would have positive implications both for port and terminal managers and for other supply chain participants. Originality/value - This study, for the first time, empirically examines the impact of the integration into supply chains of seaports on their performance. This is achieved by the development of a structural equation model which is then tested in the field, thus extending the existing literature which is largely conceptual or descriptive.","https://www.proquest.com/docview/1685807712?accountid=44943&bdid=84593&_bd=MGprplXxClbYzE4Lc6OKgwiQuCw%3D","https://doi.org/10.1108/SCM-09-2011-0264"

Advancements in Artificial Intelligence (AI) applications like collision avoidance and computer vision have the potential to augment or take over the roles of ship navigators. However, implementation of AI technologies may also jeopardize safety if done in a way that reduces human control. In this systematic review, we included 42 studies about human supervision and control of autonomous ships. We addressed three research questions (a) how is human control currently being adopted in autonomous ship systems? (b) what methods, approaches, and theories are being used to address safety concerns and design challenges? and (c) what research gaps, regulatory obstacles, and technical shortcomings represent the most significant barriers to their implementation? We found that (1) human operators have an active role in ensuring autonomous ship safety above and beyond a backup role, (2) System-Theoretic Process Analysis and Bayesian Networks are the most common risk assessment tools in risk-based design, and (3) the new role of shore control center operators will require new competencies and training. The field of autonomous ship research is growing quickly. New risks are emerging from increasing interaction with AI systems in safety–critical systems, underscoring new research questions. Effective human-AI interaction design is predicated on increased cross-disciplinary efforts, requiring reconciling productivity with safety (resilience), technical limitations with human abilities and expectations (interaction design), and machine task autonomy with human supervisory control (safety management).","https://www.proquest.com/docview/2725349856?accountid=44943&bdid=84593&_bd=OW%2BvQ3F7jqWEIO%2FWGrw5jY8cc7A%3D","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ssci.2022.105778"

To prevent any spoilage of cargoes during the long period of navigation, these containers need to be inspected daily, but it is often difficult to check and maintain them regularly with limited manpower on a ship as they are scattered around the individual cargo holding area. To deal with such situation, a reefer container monitoring system that utilizes the existing onboard power line(s) and can acquire data from the device sensors is proposed. As the advantage of this system, no additional wiring is necessary, so shipping companies can install the system on their ships at low cost.

Depending on the adopted strategy, impact of maintenance on overall expenses can remarkably vary; for example, letting an asset running up until breakdown can lead to unaffordable costs. As a matter of fact, a desideratum is to progress maintenance technology of ship propulsion systems from breakdown or preventive maintenance up to more effective condition-based maintenance approaches. The central idea in condition-based maintenance is to monitor the propulsion equipment by exploiting heterogeneous sensors, enabling diagnosis and, most of all, prognosis of the propulsion system's components and of their potential future failures. The success of condition-based maintenance clearly hinges on the capability of developing effective predictive models; for this purpose, effective use of machine learning methods is proposed in this article. In particular, authors take into consideration an application of condition-based maintenance to gas turbines used for vessel propulsion, where the performance and advantages of exploiting machine learning methods in modeling the degradation of the propulsion plant over time are tested. Experiments, conducted on data generated from a sophisticated simulator of a gas turbine, mounted on a Frigate characterized by a COmbined Diesel eLectric And Gas propulsion plant type, will allow to show the effectiveness of the proposed machine learning approaches and to benchmark them in a realistic maritime application.","https://www.proquest.com/docview/1762370428?accountid=44943&bdid=84593&_bd=WJLBfKSHKBboBQqQbR2vuzG5cp8%3D","https://doi.org/10.1177/1475090214540874"

In many cases, users of online shopping platforms have the ability to rate products on a numerical scale, and also provide textual feedback pertaining to a purchased product. Beyond using online product review platforms as customer decision support systems, this information rich data source could also aid designers seeking to increase the chances of their products being successful in the market through a deeper understanding of market needs. However, the increasing size and complexity of products on the market makes manual analysis of such data challenging. Information obtained from such sources, if not mined correctly, risks misrepresenting a product's true success/failure (e.g., a customer leaves a one star rating because of the slow shipping service of a product, not necessarily that he/she dislikes the product). The objective of this paper is three fold: I) to propose a machine learning approach that disambiguates online customer review feedback by classifying them into one of three direct product characteristics (i.e_form,function or behavior) and two indirect product characteristics (i.e., service and other), ii) to discover the machine learning algorithm that yields the highest and most generalizable results in achieving objective I) and iii) to quantify the correlation between product ratings and direct and indirect product characteristics. A case study involving review data for products mined from e-commerce websites is presented to demonstrate the validity of the proposed method. A multilayered (i.e., k-fold and leave one out) validation approach is presented to explore the generalizability of the proposed method. The resulting machine learning model achieved classification accuracies of 82.44% for within product classification, 80.84% for across product classification, 79.03% for across product type classification and 80.64% for across product domain classification. Furthermore, it was determined that the form of a product had the highest Pearson Correlation Coefficient relating to a product's star rating, with a value of 0.934.

Such networks are composed of a number of mobile wireless nodes typical of MANETs, but also have fixed (satellite) links and are continuously powered as is typical of fixed networks. Combined, these characteristics provide unique challenges not conducive to the use of existing MANET or fixed network management techniques. Since maritime units also operate in a low-bandwidth environment with varying communications capabilities, the efficiency of network management services is critical. Similarly, the lack of power constraints and slower mobility require a less dynamic solution than that required for MANETs. This article provides an overview of the maritime network management problem space including two key management opportunities provided by such an environment. The first opportunity is in automation. Maritime networks are subject to changing operational requirements, while at the same time suffering from limited availability of skilled network operators. To rapidly respond to faults and changes in performance needs, we propose the use of a serviceoriented policy- based management architecture on which a wide variety of management services can be rapidly deployed. The second key management opportunity is resource optimization. We suggest several management services that can be used to support traffic engineering. In our simulations traffic monitoring, traffic prioritization, adaptive routing, and resource reservation services were found to provide awareness and significantly improve the timeliness of prioritized flows.","https://www.proquest.com/docview/34478628?accountid=44943&bdid=84593&_bd=XZnFRDHl%2B8kU%2F8QNWMgGkUF%2Bujg%3D","https://doi.org/10.1109/MCOM.2008.4644135"

We propose low-cost, lightweight methods for near-real-time estimation of mean catchment-wide SWE using existing infrastructure, wireless sensor networks, and machine learning algorithms. Because snowpack distribution is highly nonlinear, we focus on Genetic Programming (GP), a nonlinear, white-box, inductive machine learning algorithm. Because we did not have access to near-real-time catchment-scale SWE data, we used available data as ground truth for machine learning in a set of experiments that are successive approximations of our goal of catchment-wide SWE estimation. First, we used a history of maritime snowpack data collected by manual snow courses. Second, we used distributed snow depth (HS) data collected automatically by wireless sensor networks. We compared the performance of GP against linear regression (LR), binary regression trees (BT), and a widely used basic method (BM) that naively assumes non-variable snowpack. In the first experiment set, GP and LR models predicted SWE with lower error than BM. In the second experiment set, GP had lower error than LR, but outperformed BT only when we applied a technique that specifically mitigated the possibility of over-fitting.","https://www.proquest.com/docview/1825414127?accountid=44943&bdid=84593&_bd=%2FfxDCS6XacxxZJ0yyStr86ndSAk%3D","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jhydrol.2015.02.042"

Algae bloom observation channels includes satellite remote sensing and maritime station monitoring (MSM). Compared with satellite remote sensing image, MSM can collect more accurate data, which includes various seawater inorganic salt content related to the HABs. However, the measured data of MSM is easily affected by regional sediment content and seawater dynamic field, which leads to lack the accurate forecasting models. Therefore, this paper proposed a local spatio-temporal HABs forecasted model (STHFM) based on few impact factors in MSM. The advantage of this model is to first use principal component analysis to select main environment factors (MEFs) related to HABs. Then, this model distinguishes multiple warning levels of HABs in spatio-temporal according to the algae growth rate. Finally, this paper generates continuous MEFs time series information based on the Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) model in the high-level warning area. And an improved LSTM network with MEFs time series as input is established to forecast HABs in future. The proposed model is tested on the NOAA website public dataset, which contains historical harmful algae Alexandrium data on the East Coast of US.

In order to establish more efficient ship operations, fuel consumption across the full operational profile of a vessel is needed. This could be accomplished through a complete characterisation through extensive sea-trials, or interpretation of data from monitoring systems. Results from repeated testing under controlled sea-trial conditions provides high-fidelity data, however, this approach is prohibitively expensive and requires repeating as the condition of the vessel changes with time. Conversely, data monitoring devices are relatively inexpensive, however, the process of analysing data can be complex, particularly when a ship super(3)s activities are diverse. This paper describes a methodology for associating ship activity with corresponding segments of a data-stream from a commercially available monitoring system. Further analysis is then performed to determine the fuel efficient performance of the ship. The case-study used is a harbour tug, although the approach used is applicable to other ship types, its success on this basis indicates the methodology is robust. To validate the methodology, results from the data analysis are compared to fuel consumption data measured under sea-trial conditions, and are found to be in close agreement.","https://www.proquest.com/docview/1786186900?accountid=44943&bdid=84593&_bd=Z5qzeL70kobjlqstVuRuvZFmUbs%3D","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.oceaneng.2015.09.028"

A contemporary example is the lithium (Li)-ion battery, which enabled the launch of the personal electronics revolution in 1991 and the first commercial electric vehicles in 2010. Most recently, Li-ion batteries have expanded into the electricity grid to firm variable renewable generation, increasing the efficiency and effectiveness of transmission and distribution. Important applications continue to emerge including decarbonization of heavy-duty vehicles, rail, maritime shipping, and aviation and the growth of renewable electricity and storage on the grid. This perspective compares energy storage needs and priorities in 2010 with those now and those emerging over the next few decades. The diversity of demands for energy storage requires a diversity of purpose-built batteries designed to meet disparate applications. Advances in the frontier of battery research to achieve transformative performance spanning energy and power density, capacity, charge/discharge times, cost, lifetime, and safety are highlighted, along with strategic research refinements made by the Joint Center for Energy Storage Research (JCESR) and the broader community to accommodate the changing storage needs and priorities. Innovative experimental tools with higher spatial and temporal resolution, in situ and operando characterization, first-principles simulation, high throughput computation, machine learning, and artificial intelligence work collectively to reveal the origins of the electrochemical phenomena that enable new means of energy storage.

This has led to various attempts to apply blockchain technology (BCT) to the food cold chain, such as IBM's FoodTrust and Alibaba's Food Trust Frameworks. This system is expected to guarantee food traceability and sustainability. In this research, we focused on the importance of maritime and aviation transportation in the entire supply chain, and we established the BCT-based beef cold chain system, which includes the reefer chain. Specifically, we raised the monitoring and physical infrastructure issues at the port (or airport) and maritime (aviation) transportation node and took these into consideration. Additionally, we conducted scenario analysis to investigate the effects of the suggested system. The amount of food losses and the associated greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions are calculated by different scenarios in accordance with the recall recovery time and node where a recall occurrence is recognized. For both import and export models, when the proposed BCT-based beef cold chain platform is applied, the number of discarded reefer containers and the associated GHG emissions go down by 42.1% and 21.8%, respectively. Interestingly, when we assumed the recall recognition stage was right after the defects occur, the largest effects of improving performance of the proposed platform were 48.3% in import (IM) node of the port level. These results will provide a needed solution for cold chain management at the government level and affirms the essential role of the port/airport in the cold chain.","https://www.proquest.com/docview/2718235465?accountid=44943&bdid=84593&_bd=mtZRNkxVXUIxBXKUdgWSrqmWb4k%3D","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jclepro.2022.132646"

Terminal managers must deal with a wide variety of interrelated logistic problems, and the effectiveness and productivity of the terminal depends on their solution. Management strategies are therefore necessary to increase their effectiveness and productivity, and thereby reducing the costs of these operations. This task is complicated by imprecise data and the need to satisfy several criteria, many of which are subjective, when evaluating the solutions. One of these logistic problems, the quay crane scheduling problem, has attracted the attention of many researchers since quay cranes are one of the most valuable resources in the port. Many proposals based on optimization algorithms have tackled this problem but the vast majority disregard the uncertainty inherent in this kind of systems and the impact of internal delivery vehicles. An intelligent system which integrates Artificial Intelligence techniques and simulation tools is proposed to aid terminal managers. The system combines an intelligent evolutionary algorithm to generate high quality schedules for the cranes with a simulation model that incorporates uncertainty and the impact of internal delivery vehicles. The joint use of these tools provides managers with enhanced information to decide on the quality and robustness of the proposed schedules, resulting in better solutions for everyday situations. Our intelligent system based on the optimization-simulation model provides clear benefits to maritime terminal management. The system efficiently identifies high quality schedules and can be used to evaluate its robustness. It is also flexible and can easily be adapted if other elements need to be introduced, which may affect the goodness of a schedule.","https://www.proquest.com/docview/2312229068?accountid=44943&bdid=84593&_bd=n3mPd4pau8ZnsnTbWBtZGHYkPwo%3D","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.eswa.2019.112852"

Indeed, the received big data from IoV is valuable particularly for those involved in analyzing driver’s behaviors. For instance, in the fleet management domain, fleet administrators are interested in fine-grained information about fleet usage, which is influenced by different driver usage patterns. In the vehicle insurance market, usage-based insurance or pay-as-you-drive schemes aim to adapt the insurance premium to individual driver behavior or even to provide various value-added services to policy holders. These applications can be expected to improve and to make safer the driving style of various individuals. Nowadays, big data analysis is becoming indispensable for automatic discovering of intelligence that is involved in the frequently occurring patterns and hidden rules. It is essential and necessary to study how to utilize these large-scale data. Regarding driving behaviors analysis, this paper presents a preliminary study based on feature selection and statistical approach. Feature selection is one of the important and frequently used techniques in data preprocessing for big data mining. Feature selection, as a dimensionality reduction technique, focuses on choosing a small subset of the significant features from the original data by removing irrelevant or redundant features. According to selection process, the most significant feature is vehicle speed for the collected vehicular data. Afterward, the statistical approach calculates skewness and dispersion in speed distribution as the statistical features for driving behaviors analysis. Finally, the established classification rules not only provide data-driven services and big data analytics but also offer training data samples for supervised machine learning algorithms.

Reimbursement loans are often used to credit the trade of overseas goods. The reason of such case is that the shipment of goods by the maritime transport requires a significant amount of time and those trades are often associated with high financial amounts. Since international trade (exchange) is a kind of a generator of society's progress, it is necessary to explore the possibilities for making international payment cheaper, more efficient and more secure. In this case, we based our research on the implementation of modern technologies, more precisely ""blockchain""/DLT (Distributed Ledger Technology) and ""smart contracts"". The new reimbursement loan model presented in the paper is based on the aforementioned technologies. It could potentially change not only the documentary lending techniques, but also, eventually, overall financial paradigm. The effectiveness of the application of modern technologies is proven comparing the results of the so called conventional and unconventional reimbursement credit model on a real case involving two companies in Indonesia and Singapore.

The amount of the atmospheric water vapor is being described by the atmospheric specific humidity. The values of the spectral optical atmospheric thickness are being regressed with the simultaneous values of the atmospheric specific humidity and on the wavelength of the spectral solar irradiation, during the occurrence of continental and maritime air masses. The data analysis indicates the decrease of spectral optical atmospheric thickness with increase of the wavelength of the solar beam irradiation and, mainly, the major role of the amount of atmospheric water vapor on the spectral optical atmospheric thickness due to continental or maritime aerosols. The water vapor interaction with the particles of the insoluble continental dust results to the partial wetting and growing of the dust particles. In the atmospheric specific humidity minimum, which is observed in the dry and cold season, the spectral optical atmospheric thickness is minimized with the prevalence of continental air mass. In the atmospheric specific humidity maximum, which is observed in the wet and warm season, the spectral optical atmospheric thickness is maximized with the continental air mass prevalence, too. The water vapor interaction with the soluble sea-salt crystals of maritime aerosol is opposite from this with the insoluble continental dust and results in the complete dissolution of the sea- salt crystals in the wet season. During the presence of maritime air masses, the included sea-salt aerosols are dissolved by the atmospheric water vapor and the spectral optical atmospheric thickness takes intermediate values in the near violet and visible spectral regions of the solar spectrum. The observational data analysis results in two families of regression curves of the spectral optical atmospheric thickness with the atmospheric specific humidity, one corresponding to the continental and one to the maritime aerosol.

In particular, the Douglas–Peucker (DP) and kernel density estimation (KDE) algorithms, respectively, utilized for trajectory compression and visualization, were significantly accelerated through the massively parallel computation capabilities of the GPU architecture. Comprehensive experiments on trajectory compression and visualization have been conducted on large-scale AIS data of recording ship movements collected from three different water areas, i.e., the South Channel of Yangtze River Estuary, the Chengshan Jiao Promontory, and the Zhoushan Islands. Experimental results illustrated that: 1) the proposed GPU-based parallel implementation frameworks could significantly reduce the computational time for both trajectory compression and visualization; 2) the influence of compressed vessel trajectories on trajectory visualization could be negligible if the compression threshold was selected suitably; and 3) the Gaussian kernel was capable of generating more appropriate KDE-based visualization performance by comparing with other seven kernel functions.","https://www.proquest.com/docview/2460862392?accountid=44943&bdid=84593&_bd=GuKFQCuudAWx5we4sOj8r%2FPnDw8%3D","https://doi.org/10.1109/JIOT.2020.2989398"

In this study, a real-time evaluation method combing big data of ship energy efficiency with physics-based analysis is proposed to judge the degradation of main engine performance and assist in determining the maintenance schedule. Firstly, based on the developed ship energy efficiency big data platform, the distribution statistics and comparison of different operating states are carried out. Gaussian mixture model (GMM) and Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise (DBSCAN) are used to cluster the data and the high-density data areas are obtained as the analysis points. Then, the data of the analysis points are polynomial fitted, by the least square method, to obtain the propulsion characteristics curves, load characteristic curves, and speed characteristic curves, which can be used to observe the performance degradation of the main engine. The results show that this method can effectively monitor the degradation degree of the main engine performance, and is of great significance to fuel efficiency improvements and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions reduction.","https://www.proquest.com/docview/2729945479?accountid=44943&bdid=84593&_bd=ee8l4O%2B0ussT1MgKuFy7Axxq2gA%3D","https://doi.org/10.2478/pomr-2022-0033"

Hence, emerging studies have been conducted to develop an objective and non-intrusive approach to assessing vigilance levels and generate warnings if needed. This study aims to investigate the effects of impaired vigilance on human performance via non-intrusive data analysis, namely spatial and temporal gaze pattern analytics, and develop an objective model for vigilance assessment accordingly. A novel four-phase framework, including vigilance test design, non-intrusive data collection, spatial and temporal gaze pattern analytics, and a shallow neural network-based model was proposed to achieve this aim. Meanwhile, an illustrative experiment in the maritime industry was conducted to verify the proposed method. The spatial and temporal gaze patterns analytics revealed that low vigilance levels impacted comprehension time but not perception time, with longer fixations duration but stable time-to-the-nearest-fixation under a low vigilance level. It is found that even a person with impaired vigilance can quickly notice abnormal events. The effectiveness and empirical implications of this model can help traffic controllers avoid fatigue-induced vigilance reduction. In addition, it provides evidence, references, and solutions for designing human–computer interfaces to reduce human errors caused by low vigilance.","https://www.proquest.com/docview/2638773060?accountid=44943&bdid=84593&_bd=CSmi9AI1kEyuH1p7jDrJC4iJRkI%3D","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.knosys.2021.108047"

Valid and reliable data sets on ships' energy consumption are often missing in shipping markets and within shipping organizations, leading to the non-implementation of cost-effective energy efficiency measures. Policy makers are aiming to remedy this, e.g., through the EU Monitoring, Verification and Reporting scheme. In this paper, current practices for energy consumption monitoring in ship operations are explored based on interviews with 55 professionals in 34 shipping organizations in Denmark. Best practices, which require several years to implement, are identified, as are common challenges in implementing such practices—related to data collection, incentives for data misreporting, data analysis problems, as well as feedback and communication problems between ship and shore. This study shows how the logic of good energy consumption monitoring practices conflict with common business practices in shipping companies – e.g., through short-term vessel charters and temporary ship organizations – which in turn can explain the slow adoption of energy efficiency measures in the industry. This study demonstrates a role for policy makers or other third parties in mandating or standardizing good energy consumption monitoring practices beyond the present requirements.","https://www.proquest.com/docview/2000322536?accountid=44943&bdid=84593&_bd=NrPjTkcD6qh%2Bxn%2BNfunOqFaoAJQ%3D","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jclepro.2015.08.032"

Canadian soils and peatlands are assumed to store approximately 20% of the world’s soil carbon stock. However, the spatial and vertical distributions of the soil organic carbon (SOC) concentration in Canada have not been systematically investigated. SOC concentration, expressed in g C kg⁻¹ soil, affects the chemical and physical properties of the soil, such as water infiltration ability, moisture holding capacity, nutrient availability, and the biological activity of microorganisms. In this study, we tested a three dimensional (3D) machine learning approach and 40 spatial predictors derived from 20 years of optical and microwave satellite observations to estimate the spatial and vertical distributions of SOC concentration in Canada in six depth intervals up to 1 m. A quantile regression forest method was used to build an uncertainty map showing 80% of prediction intervals. Results showed that a random forest model associated with 25 covariates was successful in capturing 83% of spatial and vertical SOC variation over the country. Soil depth was the most important covariate to predict SOC concentration, followed by surface temperature and elevation. The SOC concentration in forested areas was highest in the top layers (0–5 cm), but soils located in peatlands showed higher C concentration in all soil depths. Among the terrestrial ecozones of Canada, Pacific Maritime and the Hudson Plain mostly covered by forest trees and peatlands, respectively, show highest SOC concentration, while the lowest concentration are observed in the Prairies and Mixed Wood Plain ecosystems that are the agricultural areas of the country. This study provides a deeper understanding of the major factors controlling SOC concentration in Canada and shows potential areas with high carbon reserves, which are crucial in view of the ongoing climate change. In addition, the presented methodological framework has great potential to be used in future soil carbon storage inventories using satellite observations. Mapping SOC concentration and associated uncertainties in Canada are fundamental to detect trends of gains or losses in SOC linked to recent and future national or global policy decisions related to soil quality and carbon sequestration.","https://www.proquest.com/docview/2636839576?accountid=44943&bdid=84593&_bd=55vBU9jpe4cGmlV7LY%2BHwrsSPoc%3D","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.geoderma.2021.115402"

Traditional VMSs use a cloud centralized computing model, and the storage, processing, and visualization of all fishing vessel data are completed in the monitoring center. Due to the limitation of maritime communications, the data generated by fishing vessels cannot be fully utilized, and communication delays lead to inadequate warnings in cases of fishing vessel abnormalities. In this paper, we present a real-time anomaly detection model (RADM) for fishing vessels based on edge computing. The model runs in the edge layer, making full use of the information of moving edge nodes and nearby nodes, and combines a historical trajectory extraction detection model with an online anomaly detection model to detect anomalies. The detection model of historical trajectory extraction mines frequent patterns in historical trajectories through multifeature clustering and identifies trajectories that are different from the frequent patterns as anomalies. Online anomaly detection algorithms detect anomalous behavior in specific scenarios based on the spatiotemporal neighborhood similarity and reduce the impact of anomaly evolution.

Underwater acoustic communications (UAC) network channels are fast-varying (spatially and temporally) according to environmental conditions. It is tempting to use adaptive modulation and coding (AMC) for UAC networks to improve the system efficiency by matching transmission parameters to channel variations. This paper focuses on analyzing a measured sea trial dataset by using a rule-based strategy (i.e., three-dimensional analysis, modulation-wise analysis, and a fixed-SNR strategy) to find the suitable link adaptation procedure depending on the channel quality. Hence, we plot a scenario of the measured UAC network data rate vs. Signal to Noise Ratio (SNR) and/or Bit Error Rate (BER) to pick the best AMC combinations in the context of adaptivity to the channel. Due to non-reversibility limitation of rule-based strategy, the work further extends to use machine learning (ML) algorithms to classify the MCS levels by investigating the channel characteristics. Boosted regression tree, from among the four ML algorithms we adopted for the analysis, shows formidable accuracy of 99.97% in classifying MCS levels. This ensemble of trees learns from the uplink data of the buoy and the base station and relates the MCS levels to channel metrics and signal characteristics especially subject to SNR and BER constraints.","https://www.proquest.com/docview/2454092610?accountid=44943&bdid=84593&_bd=F9ETWhe4nPyfMGWkU%2BwxQTzhfM8%3D","https://doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2020.2981973"

In the last decade, there has been an increasing demand for new extraction techniques enabling automation, shorter extraction time, and reduced consumption of organic solvent. In this study, Response Surface Methodology (RSM) was used to evaluate the effects of two processing parameters of an alternative extraction process: instantaneous controlled pressure drop: 'Detente Instantanee Controlee' (D.I.C.) on the yield and composition of oil isolated from maritime pine needles (Pinus pinaster). This process involves subjecting the substrate for a short time to steam varying from 1.5 to 5.5 bar (113 to 155DGC) for 4 to 20 minutes, followed by an instantaneous decompression to a vacuum (about 50 mbar). We studied the effect of processing pressure and processing time on the yield of oil and in three important compounds: a -pinene, b -pinene, and germacrene D. Both the processing pressure and time had a significant effect on all responses studied. For the less volatile compound, a -pinene, the maximum quantity was obtained at the lower processing pressure and time, while an inverse trend was observed for b -pinene and germacrene D. The models displayed by the experimental design gave R2 higher than 0.92.","https://www.proquest.com/docview/34661074?accountid=44943&bdid=84593&_bd=spSl0nF2RINOMwZG90BRxVJEsYU%3D","https://doi.org/10.1080/02773810902879025"

The human supervisory controller has no direct need to constantly know what the status is of all parts of the automation and the system it is controlling, because the highly automated DPS is controlling all components itself. Only after a failure arises, the operator needs to take over manual control and take appropriate action(s) to prevent the failure from harming the operation. As the supervisory controller may be out of the loop, swiftly taking over control may be problematic when failures arise. The purpose of the current study was to investigate whether automation of change detection enables human operators with low awareness of the automation and the system it is controlling to quickly recover awareness in emergency take-over situations. A 2 by 2 within subjects experiment was conducted using a DP simulation (n = 22). Within-subjects factors were support (Yes, No) and interruption (Yes, No). Results showed that change detection support helps in the process of recovering situation awareness after it has been reduced, due to an interruption of the primary task of overseeing the automation. Interestingly, support was not beneficial to the participants in all conditions. In non-interrupted conditions the support unexpectedly resulted in higher workload, raising questions whether supervisory controllers should be supported continuously or only when it is required. Relevance to industry: The results show that change detection support has potential value in operational maritime environments, especially in situations where the DP operator has low situation awareness. Future research should investigate whether adaptive aiding could alleviate some of the negative effects of non-adaptive operator support in maritime environments.","https://www.proquest.com/docview/2097969683?accountid=44943&bdid=84593&_bd=ODForPzH%2BqOWtU36W4XPWCsznUk%3D",""

Many critical waterways in the world are becoming more crowded due to many factors in waterway environments, such as invisibility, variability, and uncertainty. Accurate water depth information is necessary to improve navigation safety. Water depth information of electronic charts cannot be updated in a timely way, while the actual water depth is unpredictable, and this factor threatens the safety of vessels in waterway environments. Based on the shore-based network, ship navigation data and other big data can be integrated to vessels navigation environments in real time. In this paper, we present a new scheme to quickly and accurately construct a vessel safety navigation depth reference map, which contains appropriate channel water depth information. This effective scheme is based on automated identification system (AIS) data and increases the travel safety through crowded waterways. AIS data include rich maritime traffic information. Both the static and the dynamic information about vessels through waterways can be extracted and processed from big real-time AIS data. Based on extensive actual experiments, we apply data mining techniques to extract the waterway depth information both draft-depth and vessel trajectories based on AIS data. The data are collected from vessels in both locations: 1) the Nantong port, in Jiangsu Province, China and 2) Meizhou Bay waterway, in Fujian Province, China. The Hermite interpolation scheme is used to patch the trajectories of vessels, and the BP neural network model is introduced to predict the maximum vessel draft. Clustering and data fusion methods are employed to construct a vessel safety navigation depth reference map according to the cluster area of vessel trajectories and draft information. The experimental results demonstrate that the vessel safety navigation depth reference map accurately reflects the current water depth profile of channels. This paper can provide accurate and timely channel water-depth information for the vessel navigation and the maritime supervision. The proposed scheme in this paper can also provide reference for trajectory data processing and mining.","https://www.proquest.com/docview/2455934419?accountid=44943&bdid=84593&_bd=eC6Fnj%2FhM0m86Kws8Gijo%2B2hK1A%3D","https://doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2018.2883421"

This paper presents a method for ship encounter risk evaluation, in which trajectory data of large ships is analyzed to extract ship encounter data, a probabilistic model is built to determine whether an encounter event results in a near-miss, and a risk index is proposed to evaluate the risk of a ship encounter situation resulting in a near-miss or collision.

However, most drivers do not have access to such systems. The required monitoring platform would have to deliver the required performance while also being affordable and accessible. A candidate with considerable promise is the smartphone with sensors built-in that could be exploited for the detection of driving events. However, to date it has not been possible to achieve the required correct, missed and false detection rates in addition to the computational efficiency for real-time operations. This paper proposes a novel bagging tree and dynamic time warping (DTW) integrated algorithm for the detection of driving events employing acceleration and orientation data from a smartphone’s low cost three-axis accelerometers and gyroscopes. The bagging tree-based machine learning algorithm provides the initial maneuver detection results, as well as the location of the event start and end points. Event detection is then achieved by calculating the similarity of the results predicted through the bagging tree algorithm with the corresponding templates extracted from the experience datasets, while also applying a number of constraints to verify the calculated results. Field test results show that the proposed integrated algorithm is superior to the state-of-the-art, achieving a high correct detection accuracy of 97.5%, a low missed detection of 2.5% and a false detection rate of 2.9%. The corresponding results for the best alternative candidate method are 90.2%, 9.8% and 11.7%.

Cloud computing, a major paradigm shift for the IT industry, threatens that leadership position. Cloud computing drives the value chain increasingly toward systems software and services. It has a major negative impact on the already marginal profit picture that threatens Taiwan's hardware manufacturing industry, and the Taiwan economy as a whole. The Institute for Information Industry (III) has devised a strategy and technology called cloud appliances for enterprises (CAFÉ) to address the effects of this technology shift. CAFÉ is a major initiative to help traditional Taiwanese OEM/ODM vendors transform themselves from primarily being commodity hardware providers into highly profitable, full-function cloud systems business that can reach worldwide markets. The III develops key system software components (CAFÉ technology components) that can be integrated with partners' hardware and other technology to create appliances that deliver cloud infrastructure and services enabling enterprises to establish private clouds (thus the name CAFÉ). Appliances that offer user-ready services and applications, provide significantly higher value to customers, support higher prices than hardware alone, and thereby increase the profit margin of Taiwanese IT vendors. Key Taiwan hardware vendors that have already adapted the CAFÉ strategy include ASUS, Delta Electronics, GIGABYTE, In Win, and Promise Technology. They are developing, integrating, and shipping cloud appliances that incorporate CAFÉ technology components, as well as their own technology. The CAFÉ strategy has turned the cloud computing challenge into a golden opportunity, moving the IT industry of Taiwan toward the next horizon.

That process faces several challenges, namely greenhouse gas emissions from the consumption of fossil fuels, International Maritime Organization's (IMOs) strict international legal system on environmental pollution prevention, and new energy efficiency standards for design and management of commercial fleets. With the integration of electrical systems and power supply equipment in maritime transport in the past several decades, the availability of electric propulsion systems have brought several benefits to ship owners, including improved ability to comply with international laws, increased flexibility and reliability, reduced operating costs, and enhanced access to advanced automation capabilities. However, the introduced benefits of electrical and hybrid electric propulsion system architectures in recent years have put considerable pressure on ship owners and designers when optimizing the vessel's propulsion and power system and their control strategies. This paper presents a comprehensive review of conventional and advanced electrical propulsion systems on current commercial vessels and future smart ships. By highlighting the characteristics of the propulsion system configuration, electric power source, and propulsors, the authors present a detailed comparison and analysis in optimizing the choice of electric or hybrid powertrain systems for commercial fleets. Taking into account the increasingly stringent standards related to energy efficiency and emissions regulated by IMO, this paper also addresses strategies for the development of sustainable maritime transport by proposing the efficient use of renewable energy sources and electrical energy storage system.","https://www.proquest.com/docview/2591901060?accountid=44943&bdid=84593&_bd=FSMnGBnfXdnk39bEk9t3%2Fq3Tw7Y%3D","https://doi.org/10.1002/2050-7038.12580"

When it comes to the international maritime transport sector, coordinated port state control efforts have been a powerful tool against substandard shipping practices, and this paper intends to set the framework for introducing such control system in the industrial fishing sector. Such control, via inspection regime, will be feasible once the International Maritime Organisation Cape Town Agreement of 2012 enters into force, provided that transparent data is made available by all stakeholders, firstly at the level of countries which are members of Paris Memorandum of understanding and probably when most members are parties to the relevant conventions. Automatic identification system data helped to determine the inspection effort and leads to conclude that this will likely be concentrated in time and in a limited number of ports. We examined the current risk profile after a consultation with stakeholders and concluded that it is not adequate for industrial fishing vessels. We also concluded that port state control memorandums will probably require to set an inspection effort based on the number of calls in a parallel but separate regime to that of merchant ships, due to the differences with merchant ships. However, the current memorandums and agreements could well encompass industrial fishing vessels considering the current historic records in relation to flag state performance. Furthermore, it would be possible but complex to introduce social, economic and fisheries parameters in the risk profile for port state control, which could contribute to deter illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing.","https://www.proquest.com/docview/2612762208?accountid=44943&bdid=84593&_bd=79da3Bd3kqKvKfBtLDGB7YB1TRQ%3D","https://doi.org/10.1007/s13437-021-00251-1"

The capability to predict the fuel consumption of ships plays a significant role in the optimization process. To date, most research on predicting ship fuel consumption did not consider marine environmental factors such as wind, wave, current, and etc. Furthermore, traditional statistical methods on predicting ship fuel consumption have low accuracy. In this paper, two different sets of data showing the fuel consumption of a voyage ship with and without the influence of marine environmental factors were obtained. The Back-Propagation Neural Network (BPNN) and Gaussian Process Regression (GPR) techniques in machine learning were used to train and predict the two datasets. Thereafter, the predictive performance of these two techniques was compared and analyzed. Results showed that both techniques were able to accurately predict the ship fuel consumption, especially on the dataset with the influence of marine environmental factors. Quantitatively, the mean prediction accuracy for GPR (mean R2 = 0.9887) is slightly higher than BPNN (mean R2 = 0.9817). However, GPR requires longer runtime (mean T = 2236.4 s) compared to BPNN (mean T = 14.7 s). Due to the longer runtime, GPR is less preferable for online and real-time prediction of enroute ship fuel consumption. The ship real-time fuel consumption data can be accurately predicted by machine learning, which will be beneficial to achieve the goal of ship fuel consumption optimization and greenhouse gas emission reduction in the future.","https://www.proquest.com/docview/2455596610?accountid=44943&bdid=84593&_bd=ThqZdCihV%2F5DycAsG%2F4ZAGgVXa8%3D","https://doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2019.2933630"

The proposed IoMT device and gateway play a role similar to the IoT device and gateway on land, but it is optimized for marine use with consideration of the practical characteristics of using sensors in the ocean. Furthermore, to realize long-range and high-rate communication between marine sensors and a control center (CC) on land, an automatic beam adjustment system for directional antennas is developed. This enables the use of directional antennas, which can support long-range and high-rate communication by automatically adjusting the beam angle between the antennas while exchanging their control information, despite the antennas being shifted by undulation from the sea. Finally, we conduct real sea experiments to identify the performances of the proposed IoMT platform in various environments. The results show that the proposed IoMT platform can collect data from marine sensors as well as high definition camera video from distances of 25 and 40 km to the CC on land under one-hop and two-hop transmissions, respectively.

There are many existing solutions rooted primarily in the concept of ship domain and path-planning algorithms. However, among these, a geometrical approach to the determination of a required maneuvering area considering the dynamic nature of ship operations in close-quarters situations is still missing. Therefore, an improved concept of the CADCA (Collision Avoidance Dynamic Critical Area) is introduced for the case of ship allision. The CADCA is a deterministic zone that geometrically delimits required maneuvering space of a vessel. Its shape changes depending on the operational parameters of a ship, such as the magnitude of rudder angle, initial forward speed, or planned alteration of the course. In contrast to ship domain, the CADCA is determined using the critical distance between two objects called MDTC (Minimum Distance to Collision). Therefore, the CADCA concept can be used to appoint a position of no-return in a close-quarters situation, so as to determine the time and distance of the last-minute maneuver. An improved method of CADCA determination is introduced, along with an investigation of operational factors influencing the ship's critical area in allision scenarios. The simulations have been conducted for large passenger and container ship in encounters with various stationary obstacles differing in size and shape. The results indicate that from the operational point of view, a deflection of the rudder is the most influencing factor on the size of the CADCA, while the impact of ship speed is negligible for the investigated vessels. Besides, various applications of the CADCA are proposed and discussed for both manned and prospective autonomous vessels.","https://www.proquest.com/docview/2553853300?accountid=44943&bdid=84593&_bd=9hxhKDKSZntwepwrhI1xrlsbmqI%3D","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ress.2021.107806"

The European Commission's Joint Research Centre (JRC) has developed an in-house data collection, data analysis and data visualiztion facility, known as the Blue Hub. The Blue Hub operates as a research and development platform for integrated maritime surveillance and maritime situational awareness. It has global coverage and has been applied, for example, to support counter-piracy around Africa, to investigate fishing activity and to monitor the growing ship traffic in the Arctic. In order to improve maritime awareness and support risk assessment, the JRC has started to integrate data from the marine and atmosheric science community. In particular the JRC is interested in using forecasts from operational ocean models and weather models. For the Blue Hub a new type of data server, called ERDDAP, that performs message brokering and data mediation has become an essential tool for the accessing of ocean forecast data as quickly as possible in easy to use formats. NOAA (National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration of the USA) is making global oceanography and weather data available through the Environmental Research Division's Data Access Program (ERDDAP) data broker. ERDDAP provides RESTful machine to machine communication, data brokering and data mediation by converting data to a number of standard and developer friendly formats, including some Open Geospatial Consortium formats. In this paper, we demonstrate how data brokering and mediation is making complex scientific data accessible. We show how such data is being integrated into the Blue Hub system to enhance maritime situational awareness.","https://www.proquest.com/docview/1825464719?accountid=44943&bdid=84593&_bd=n93YvW3d0bf8XlatkXOfF%2B0UBn0%3D","https://doi.org/10.1088/1755-1315/34/1/012005"

Some of the safety research is thus specialized within one discipline or operation, although the industry could benefit from a broader analysis. This virtual special issue (VSI) brings forward research combining fields and methods, with results relevant beyond the studied operations. The 14 articles offer a peek into the multidisciplinary research of safety at sea. They include research areas such as risk assessment and risk modelling, accident data analysis, and the human element and work organization. The results have several contributions to science and practice. Operations with particular outcome include fish farming; ship-to-ship collision ; coastal rescue; and different types of fishing. The combination of studies contributes largely to solve major long-lasting problems for marine and maritime safety: Fatigue; proceduralized safety management and the lack of flexibility; drills; and the heavy duties and limited resources of short sea shipping. There are numerous suggestions of how safety can be improved by regulators, industry actors, and advances in safety science. The totality in the studies supports that safety at sea requires an integration of system perspectives and practice.","https://www.proquest.com/docview/2553856807?accountid=44943&bdid=84593&_bd=5zwMdtmduTs0dfJ5dLYO4X%2B%2BVvY%3D","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ssci.2021.105249"

Leveraging the theory of large deviations, we provide the mathematical conditions for a ML classifier to exhibit error probabilities that vanish exponentially, say [Formula Omitted], where [Formula Omitted] is the number of informative observations available for testing (or another relevant parameter, such as the size of the target in an image) and [Formula Omitted] is the error rate. Such conditions depend on the Fenchel-Legendre transform of the cumulant-generating function of the Data-Driven Decision Function (D3F, i.e., what is thresholded before the final binary decision is made) learned in the training phase. As such, the D3F and the related error rate [Formula Omitted] depend on the given training set. The conditions for the exponential convergence can be verified and tested numerically exploiting the available dataset or a synthetic dataset generated according to the underlying statistical model. Coherently with the large deviations theory, we can also establish the convergence of the normalized D3F statistic to a Gaussian distribution. Furthermore, approximate error probability curves [Formula Omitted] are provided, thanks to the refined asymptotic derivation, where [Formula Omitted] represents the most representative sub-exponential terms of the error probabilities. Leveraging the refined asymptotic, we are able to compute an accurate analytical approximation of the classification performance for both the regimes of small and large values of [Formula Omitted]. Theoretical findings are corroborated by extensive numerical simulations and by the use of real-world data, acquired by an X-band maritime radar system for surveillance.","https://www.proquest.com/docview/2774332898?accountid=44943&bdid=84593&_bd=XOA0rgIdi%2FRjVt28R6d2opCse3M%3D","https://doi.org/10.1109/OJSP.2022.3232284"

However, very little research has focussed on the effects of automation on the size of the crew. This paper analyses the effects of added automation on the required size and composition of the crew on a 750 TEU short sea container vessel. A Crew Analysis Algorithm is used to determine the cheapest crew composition to perform the tasks required to operate a ship. Using this algorithm, two potential automation options are investigated: automating the navigation tasks and automating the mooring tasks. Automating the navigation tasks decreases the required crew size in the normal sailing and arrival & departure phases by 3 and 1 crew members, respectively. The loading & unloading phase is unaffected. Automating the mooring tasks reduces the required crew in the arrival & departure phase to 2. It is concluded that since individual automation options do not affect the crew requirements for all travel phases, their effect on crew reduction is limited unless several options are combined. However, with a change in task assignment and different training of crew members, a reduction of the required number of crew members is possible.","https://www.proquest.com/docview/2574124656?accountid=44943&bdid=84593&_bd=xriJwmocn9cxNOod321NdaE0HTA%3D","https://doi.org/10.1080/03088839.2020.1805645"

However, there are still lots of challenges to solve until fully autonomous systems can be employed. Artificial Intelligence (AI) has played a major role in this paradigm shift and shows great potential for solving some of these challenges, such as the docking process of an autonomous vessel. This work proposes a lightweight volumetric Convolutional Neural Network (vCNN) capable of recognizing different docking-based structures using 3D data in real-time. A synthetic-to-real domain adaptation approach is also proposed to accelerate the training process of the vCNN. This approach makes it possible to greatly decrease the cost of data acquisition and the need for advanced computational resources. Extensive experiments demonstrate an accuracy of over 90% in the recognition of different docking structures, using low resolution sensors. The inference time of the system was about 120ms on average. Results obtained using a real Autonomous Surface Vehicle (ASV) demonstrated that the vCNN trained with the synthetic-to-real domain adaptation approach is suitable for maritime mobile robots. This novel AI recognition method, combined with the utilization of 3D data, contributes to an increased robustness of the docking process regarding environmental constraints, such as rain and fog, as well as insufficient lighting in nighttime operations.","https://www.proquest.com/docview/2512229346?accountid=44943&bdid=84593&_bd=SgBEeZBni4I%2B0Wpfis%2F57m5UMac%3D","https://doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3070694"

The amount of the atmospheric water vapor is being described by the atmospheric specific humidity. The values of the spectral optical atmospheric thickness are being regressed with the simultaneous values of the atmospheric specific humidity and on the wavelength of the spectral solar irradiation, during the occurrence of continental and maritime air masses. The data analysis indicates the decrease of spectral optical atmospheric thickness with increase of the wavelength of the solar beam irradiation and, mainly, the major role of the amount of atmospheric water vapor on the spectral optical atmospheric thickness due to continental or maritime aerosols. The water vapor interaction with the particles of the insoluble continental dust results to the partial wetting and growing of the dust particles. In the atmospheric specific humidity minimum, which is observed in the dry and cold season, the spectral optical atmospheric thickness is minimized with the prevalence of continental air mass. In the atmospheric specific humidity maximum, which is observed in the wet and warm season, the spectral optical atmospheric thickness is maximized with the continental air mass prevalence, too. The water vapor interaction with the soluble sea-salt crystals of maritime aerosol is opposite from this with the insoluble continental dust and results in the complete dissolution of the sea- salt crystals in the wet season. During the presence of maritime air masses, the included sea-salt aerosols are dissolved by the atmospheric water vapor and the spectral optical atmospheric thickness takes intermediate values in the near violet and visible spectral regions of the solar spectrum. The observational data analysis results in two families of regression curves of the spectral optical atmospheric thickness with the atmospheric specific humidity, one corresponding to the continental and one to the maritime aerosol. The aim of this work is the explanation of the physical phenomenon of the hot sunrays during some winter days and of the weak sunrays during summer days.","https://www.proquest.com/docview/29053920?accountid=44943&bdid=84593&_bd=5B1Hgvsdl8m9dZdgUjE32GaoV3w%3D","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.atmosres.2005.02.004"

TTPs can be costly, a single point of failure, and subject to hacking, privacy evasion, and compromise. The blockchain is an immutable, trusted, and decentralized ledger with logs and events that can be used for transparency, traceability, and tracking. In this paper, we present a solution and a general framework using the popular permissionless Ethereum blockchain to create a trusted, decentralized PoD system that ensures accountability, auditability, and integrity. The solution uses Ethereum smart contracts to prove the delivery of a shipped item between a seller and a buyer irrespective of the number of intermediate transporters needed. In our proposed solution, all participating entities are incentivized to act honestly by using a double deposit collateral. Automated payment in ether is an integral part of a solution to ensure that every entity gets its intended share of ether upon successful delivery. An arbitration mechanism is also incorporated if a dispute arises during the shipping process.

It has been presented by increasing the number of ships with sufficiency of sizes and kinds. This development always associates with the environmental pollution. The main reason for this that International Maritime Organization required all ships conform to the International Convention for the Prevention of Pollution from Ships (MARPOL 73/78) and that they want their ships operate in the international routes. Especially, MARPOL 73/78, Annex VI—Prevention of Air Pollution from Ships, gradually impacts the limited value of low-sulfur-content fuel oil on ships no more than 0.50% m/m (mass by mass) from 1 January 2020, against the limit of 1.00% in effect up until 31 December 2014.

In Vietnam, VINIC shipping transportation company also has the solution in changing-over procedures from heavy fuel oil into light heavy fuel oil with low-sulfur content for bulk carriers. Based on the development of science and technology nowadays, especially machine learning method, the author has designed prediction model of low-sulfur-content fuel oil consumption by applying artificial neural networks model. The object of this study is a bulk carrier of VINIC shipping transportation company in Vietnam with ship name M/V NORD VENUS 80,000 DWT. The mass of low-sulfur-content fuel oil consumption has been recorded and compared with the results collected in this research when ship sailed on emission control areas. The simulation results of prediction model have been represented on artificial neural networks tool of MATLAB program. The advantage of this model will be represented through comparing with traditional statistical regression methods. The artificial neural networks prediction model of low-sulfur-content fuel oil consumption is more reliable than other traditional methods. The traditional statistical regression methods have been supported in this case by Minitab software. The superior model will save the low-sulfur-content fuel oil on bulk carriers and reduce the sea environmental pollution.

Background and Objectives: Maritime pine (Pinus pinaster Aiton) forests in Portugal were lately affected by wildfires and measures to overcome this situation are needed. The aims of this study were: (1) to model species’ spatial distribution and productivity using a machine learning (ML) regression approach to produce current species’ distribution and productivity maps; (2) to model the species’ spatial productivity using a stochastic sequential simulation approach to produce the species’ current productivity map; (3) to produce the species’ potential distribution map, by using a ML classification approach to define species’ ecological envelope thresholds; and (4) to identify present and future key factors for the species’ afforestation and management. Materials and Methods: Spatial land cover/land use data, inventory, and environmental data (climate, topography, and soil) were used in a coupled ML regression and stochastic sequential simulation approaches to model species’ current and potential distributions and productivity. Results: Maritime pine spatial distribution modelling by the ML approach provided 69% fitting efficiency, while species productivity modelling achieved only 43%. The species’ potential area covered 60% of the country’s area, where 78% of the species’ forest inventory plots (1995) were found. The change in the Maritime pine stands’ age structure observed in the last decades is causing the species’ recovery by natural regeneration to be at risk. Conclusions: The maps produced allow for best site identification for species afforestation, wood production regulation support, landscape planning considering species’ diversity, and fire hazard mitigation. These maps were obtained by modelling using environmental covariates, such as climate attributes, so their projection in future climate change scenarios can be performed.","https://www.proquest.com/docview/2524240528?accountid=44943&bdid=84593&_bd=d0NxLfmTLh7Yr4J5JAmmzAuWanw%3D","https://doi.org/10.3390/f12030368"

In order to establish more efficient ship operations, fuel consumption across the full operational profile of a vessel is needed. This could be accomplished through a complete characterisation through extensive sea-trials, or interpretation of data from monitoring systems. Results from repeated testing under controlled sea-trial conditions provides high-fidelity data, however, this approach is prohibitively expensive and requires repeating as the condition of the vessel changes with time. Conversely, data monitoring devices are relatively inexpensive, however, the process of analysing data can be complex, particularly when a ship super(3)s activities are diverse. This paper describes a methodology for associating ship activity with corresponding segments of a data-stream from a commercially available monitoring system. Further analysis is then performed to determine the fuel efficient performance of the ship. The case-study used is a harbour tug, although the approach used is applicable to other ship types, its success on this basis indicates the methodology is robust. To validate the methodology, results from the data analysis are compared to fuel consumption data measured under sea-trial conditions, and are found to be in close agreement.","https://www.proquest.com/docview/1762373897?accountid=44943&bdid=84593&_bd=9IrVGZ%2BBLwKe6cJzYmWAO7jYfWw%3D","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.oceaneng.2015.09.028"

In major touristic destinations, the singular need of cruise liners to keep supplying energy to on-board services and amenities while docked, has raised concerns about this industry contribution to pollutant emissions. To estimate the impact of port activities and that exclusively due to cruises, classical approaches would rely on atmospheric dispersion models. Although these tools retain the underlying physics, lack of details on background flow state and emission inventories limits their predictive capabilities. Using historical data on pollutant concentration, meteorology and traffic intensity at specific locations across the city of Barcelona, it was found that predictions of local pollutant concentration by the present Machine Learning tool are more accurate than those provided by the CALIOPE-Urban-v1.0 in our test cases.

However, with the rapid development of satellite remote sensing technology, remote sensing data have gradually begun to show the characteristics of “big data”; additionally, the accuracy and speed of ship detection can be improved by analysing big data, such as by deep learning.

Ships are becoming more and more specialized in design and function in order to meet the need for rationalization both in its technical and commercial aspects. Giant tankers, bulk carriers, and container ships spearhead the revolution but many extremely forward looking new concepts of cargo handling and transportation systems are already in the pipeline. On the ship itself a technological revolution is progressing towards inevitable comprehensive automation as a remedy for economic ills. Diagnosis shows that the chronic shortage of certificated seagoing engineers, superimposed on the urgent necessity for increased economy and higher efficiency over the whole complex of shipboard operation, leaves little alternative to the automation prescription. It is true, of course, that automatic control of isolated individual elements of machinery has been featured at sea for a long long time. The escalation, however, in recent years from individual isolated application to overall centralized automatic control of the machinery from a control station sited inside the engine room (or outside), is indicative of the palliative and remedial action of the medicine as prescribed.

High steel weight implies high initial CO2 footprint but also higher operational CO2 footprint. With requirements to decreased emissions through IMO indices EEDI and CII, it is beneficial to lower the steel weight but without compromising safety. Utilizing sensor technology may enhance the safety and potentially allow for a more optimized structural design. For hull girder loading this is related to hull stress monitoring systems. Container ships are becoming increasingly important in the shipping industry. As manufactured goods are increasingly containerized, the container ship fleet has expanded. According to DNV's hull monitoring rules, it is required to provide a forecast prediction based on recent measurement data to alarm the captain of potential extreme hull girder loading. If this forecast prediction is too low then a false impression of safety is provided, and if the prediction is frequently too high the captain may lose confidence in the system. These results are not acceptable, and it is therefore necessary that this prediction is reliable. This paper highlights modern challenges and ideas, incorporating novel statistical method to serve safe navigation. Trans-Atlantic voyages along with monitored onboard hull girder response data are discussed. Sequence of the latest data from each individual sensor shall be displayed as a trend. Current rules states that 4-hour data sequence from each individual sensor shall form the basis for a forecast trend prediction of the expected response for at least the next hour. Encountered maximum stress may overshoot predictions by 50%, which is regarded unreliable. If too high values are predicted all the time, captain lose confidence and trust in the system trend analysis. If too low values are predicted the system provides false impression of safety. Both outcomes are unacceptable. Special focus is paid to whipping, which is defined as a transient hull girder vibration phenomenon caused by wave impacts. The vibration decays slowly because of low damping, which results in whipping being superimposed on both the wave sagging and wave hogging cycle. The challenge is that the whipping may be of more freak nature than the more conventional wave bending considered in design. Predicted stress level obtained by extrapolation is focused on extreme value for the sake of vessel hull safe navigation. Extrapolation by ACER (averaged conditional exceedance rate) method was done, including uncertainty bands. Main motivation for this paper is to contribute to the development of reliability assessment methods for decision support on board ships which may facilitate an improved balance between safety and structural design. Seamanship is already a factor in ship design but through digitalization it may be enhanced allowing for some steel optimization without compromising safety.","https://www.proquest.com/docview/2682859916?accountid=44943&bdid=84593&_bd=MP%2B5AoVhR283uNUfe8qxJW7eQuQ%3D",""

These tasks bring several challenging issues in developing intelligent solutions for handling large-scale and continuous video data. In this special issue, we selected five papers from submissions. A summary of these papers is outlined below. In the paper entitled ""Edge Computing Offloading at Middle-sea Scenario for Maritime Video Surveillances"" by Ziyang Gong et al., the authors combine mobile edge computing with abundant node resources, and the network connectivity delay characteristics to handle massive maritime video surveillance information. They establish SSU (single-user single-hop unicast), MSUS1, and MSUS2 (multi-user single-hop unicast models) models based on the middle-sea scenario, and divide the optimization problems into two sub-problems. A binary search method is proposed to optimize the transmission power allocation. The methods of OAAS (offloading algorithm based on alternating selection), OAMOAS (multi-objective alternating selection), and OANR (node redistribution offloading algorithm) are proposed to optimize the offloading decision allocation. The experiment shows that their method outperforms in saving delay. In the paper entitled ""Segmentation-Based Decision Networks for Steel Surface Defect Detection"" by Zhongqin Bi et al., the authors explore the use of different numbers of labels with various accuracies during training to achieve the maximum detection accuracy with the lowest cost. The proposed method includes the improved segmentation and decision networks. An attention mechanism is integrated into the segmentation subnetwork. The atrous convolutions are used in the segmentation and decision subnetworks. Then, the original loss function is improved. Experiments are carried out on the Severstal Steel Defect dataset. The results show that the detection accuracy is improved by 1% to 2%. In the paper entitled ""A Multi-modal Feature Fusion-based Approach for Mobile Application Classification and Recommendation"" by Buqing Cao et al., the authors propose a mobile application classification and recommendation method based on multimodal feature fusion. First, the method extracts the image and description features of the mobile application using the TRedBert model, such as the integration of involution residual network and pre-trained language representation model. Second, these features are fused by using the attention mechanism in the transformer model. Then, the classification results of the mobile applications are based on Softmax. Finally, the method extracts the high-order and low-order embedding features of the mobile app with FiBiNET (a bi-linear feature interaction) model, to update the mobile app representation and complete the recommendation task. The experiment results demonstrated that the proposed approach outperforms other methods in terms of F1, Accuracy, AUC, and Log-loss. In the paper entitled ""IAMPDNet: Instance-aware and Multi-part Decoupled Network for Joint Detection and Embedding"" by Pan Yang et al., the authors point out that intelligent video surveillance methods have been widely investigated to address largescale video data, among which multi-object tracking (MOT) is the most popular method, which aims to track every object appearing in the video for monitoring. For accelerating the inference speed, the method of joint detection and embedding (JDE) has become a new paradigm for MOT. Thus, the authors propose an instance-aware and multi-part decoupled network (IAMPDNet), which can perceive all instances in the environment and extract multi-part features from the instances. IAMPDNet consists of three key modules: a complementary attention module used to perceive all instances in the environment, a feature extraction module used to decouple multi-part features from the instances, and an adaptive aggregation module used to fuse multi-level features of instances. Experiments on MOT benchmarks demonstrate that IAMPDNet achieves higher tracking accuracy and lower identity switches against recent MOT methods. In the paper entitled ""Time-based calibration: A way to ensure that stitched images are captured simultaneously"" by Ziwei Song et al., the authors propose a multi-source video frames calibration technique based on external information sources for solving the problems of ghosting and cutting when stitching with different video sources. The proposed method calibrates the video stitching by introducing an information source and calculating the time difference between different devices. Experiments show that the error of the calibrated video stitching is less than 33 ms, which guarantees the quality of the spliced video.","https://www.proquest.com/docview/2739797608?accountid=44943&bdid=84593&_bd=8almzZMLHj8dhdYhYQadm9mz%2Fz0%3D",""

The ship operators use the collision risk index (CRI) to detect the risk of a collision and take the necessary action. However, CRI can be assessed differently depending on various operating conditions or other vessels or encounter conditions, making it difficult to calculate such risk accurately and efficiently. In this study, a new method for calculating the CRI by combining machine learning with D-S theory is proposed to increase the efficiency of the computations while preserving the prediction accuracy of the CRI. Different machine learning models have been investigated and compared based on model accuracy and computational time, and the results showed that the gradient boosting regression (GBR) model efficiently estimates the collision risk and increases the calculation speed compared to the D-S theory.

The automation implemented thus far did not justify premium prices from the customers anymore. Customers were able to receive the same services that ABC was able to provide using this automation, at competitive prices from other providers in the market. It was obvious to the management that a value added service had to be provided to keep the edge over the competition. Looking at the changing business landscape, one area that was identified as critical was a customer centric approach using automation. The results from the implementation of such a system were expected to be tremendous for the organization to counter the competitive pressure of rival organizations and maintain market leadership.","https://www.proquest.com/docview/33049854?accountid=44943&bdid=84593&_bd=Xtecb8qM0wgCli4IHptiRfIhNNI%3D",""

However, one common bottleneck for a ship's operator is that often important information that would be required to develop more complete DTs are not available to them. As part of an overall objective to devise a comprehensive system of technologies to improve ship energy management, the German R&D project MariData considers such accuracy aspects. These are demonstrated using one of the project's target vessels, a 183m (Loa) tanker (called CBT) operated by Carl Buttner Shipmanagement which was built in 2019 after thorough form optimization over a given operational profile.

A neural network-based approach for augmenting traditional radar detector structures using machine learning (ML) is proposed in this paper. Specifically, the network is designed to augment target detection in the field of maritime wide area surveillance for non-coherent data. A combination network consisting of a convolutional neural network (CNN) to extract spatial features and a long short-term memory (LSTM) for extracting temporal patterns in the spatial features is proposed. The network augments the detector structure by blanking out regions of the frame which are classified as not containing a target, thus reducing false alarms. The network is tested on data containing four marine targets collected by a ground-based radar. The data set was chosen because it contains strong sea clutter returns. When ML is used, the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves are shifted to lower probability of false alarm (PFA). A Kalman filter tracker was applied to the ML-augmented and baseline detections, and it was shown that ML-augmented detections produced similar tracks at lower PFA. The feature discovering capability of the network is analyzed through a series of tests, and the argument is made that the CNN-LSTM network presented in this work demonstrates the ability to improve the detection performance by exploiting spatial and temporal information in the data.","https://www.proquest.com/docview/2454680713?accountid=44943&bdid=84593&_bd=SNFDoG%2BA7kL6ffak%2Bq8zyEzB%2BZs%3D","https://doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2020.3025144"

With much effort directed towards merchant shipping, technical designs for urban ferries are also under development to facilitate smart mobility. Safety perceptions of such autonomous ferries are likely important drivers of the adoption of such novel technologies. Understanding the public's perceived benefits and concerns can support policy makers and industry in implementing responsible risk governance and can have design and operational implications. This article explores this topic for a hypothetical autonomous urban ferry in Halifax, Nova Scotia. Through phone surveys and interviews, focus is on safety perceptions of different automation degrees, which are further explored in relation to selected population characteristics. Improved environmental performance is the most important perceived benefit, whereas safety is the most important concern. Overall, there is support for increased automation, but an on-board presence of qualified operators is considered important for safety and security related reasons. Remotely controlled ferries without onboard personnel or fully autonomous vessels are generally perceived as (very) unsafe. Men are slightly more favourable of increased automation than women, as are people with more digital knowledge and skills. Acknowledging several limitations of this exploratory study, of which the focus on older age groups in the studied population is the most significant, the findings suggest that understanding the public's safety perceptions is important to ensure the successful design, implementation, and operation of autonomous urban, so that the envisaged benefits of these new systems can be achieved.","https://www.proquest.com/docview/2618809081?accountid=44943&bdid=84593&_bd=H%2FtK9mz61ty7uQBGMqIcwXca3%2BM%3D","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ssci.2021.105496"

At the same time, the market downturn in traditional oil and gas leads to a reduced implementation of new reference system solutions. A development toward higher levels of autonomy in novel operations drives the development from traditional reference systems toward solutions capable of proximity awareness and connectivity. The existing reference system technologies comprise a good platform for this development, but new technology elements like new sensor fusion concepts, machine learning, artificial intelligence, and extended connectivity are evolving.

The AIS is a self-reporting system that uses the VHF radio link. However, any radio-based self-reporting system is prone to forgery, especially in situations where authentication of the message is not designed into the architecture. As AIS was designed in the 1990s when cyberattacks were in their infancy, it does not implement authentication or encryption; thus, it can be seen as fundamentally vulnerable against cyberattacks. This paper demonstrates and evaluates the impact of multiple cyberattacks on AIS via remote radio frequency (RF) links using transmission-enabled software-defined radio (SDR). Overall, we implemented and tested a total of 11 different tests/attacks on 19 AIS setups, using a controlled environment. The tested configurations were derived from heterogeneous platforms such as Windows, Android, generic receivers, and commercial transponders. Our aim is to enhance the early discovery of new vulnerabilities in AIS to effectively address AIS attacks in the nearest future. The results showed that approximately 89% of the setups were affected by Denial-of-Service (DoS) attacks at the AIS protocol level. Besides implementing some existing attack ideas (e.g., spoofing, DoS, and flooding), we showed some novel attack concepts in the AIS context such as a coordinated attack, overwhelming alerts, and logical vulnerabilities, all of which have the potential to cause software/system crashes in the worst-case scenarios. Moreover, an implementation/specification flaw related to the AIS preamble was identified during the experiments, which may affect the interoperability of different AIS devices. The error-handling system in AIS was also investigated. Unlike the aviation sector’s Automatic Dependent Surveillance-Broadcast (ADS-B), the maritime sector’s AIS does not effectively support any error correction method, which may contribute to RF pollution and less effective use of the overall system. The consistency of our results for a comprehensive range of hardware-software configurations indicated the reliability of our approach, test system, and evaluation results.","https://www.proquest.com/docview/2641994713?accountid=44943&bdid=84593&_bd=IVOAu%2FL6%2BfnjO1rc%2F1W98PW1vlI%3D","https://doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2022.3158943"

AIS is designed for remotely tracking vessels but nowadays also becomes a useful data source to enable vessels’ trajectory prediction so as to facilitate early alert of potential collision risks. Recent studies focus on improving prediction accuracy through the machine learning and knowledge-based technologies but the computational cost also greatly increases due to the model complexity of these methodologies. It becomes a practical challenge to realize near real-time (NRT) trajectory prediction of a large volume of ships. For risk alert application, forecasting timeliness is one of the key design considerations. In this paper, we propose a concurrent processing cluster solution to empower advanced trajectory forecasting for hundreds of vessels in NRT. The proposed solution relies on the properly determined frameworks by customizing the desired features for an integrated solution. Meanwhile, a novel task-based load balancing strategy with newly defined metrics are proposed, which aims to reduce the makespan of jobs and outperforms the existing load balancing algorithms. A practicable cluster system has been successfully implemented, serving as a step toward unlocking the power of advanced maritime traffic forecasting technologies and enabling the benefit from the latest progress on the methodological innovation.","https://www.proquest.com/docview/2490802459?accountid=44943&bdid=84593&_bd=K%2BBsRAE1I3O67qS0Wt5Xt1lrrTo%3D","https://doi.org/10.1109/TSMC.2019.2906381"

Data mining and statistical analysis of climate reanalysis data are important research methods to understand the characteristics of atmospheric circulation and the occurrence of extreme climate. In this paper, we first use SOM to distinguish the anomalous general circulation models in East Asia from 1979 to 2020. According to the results, we establish the response relationship and monitoring system between various models and climatic factors, and analyze the trend and dynamic mechanism of temperature anomalies in China. Secondly, the atmospheric circulation anomaly model is related to the extreme temperature and precipitation events in East Asia, and studies the climate anomaly characteristics under the complex effects of atmospheric circulation anomaly and monsoon system. The following analysis follows all the basic characteristics of land logistics of marine logistics, but due to the high risk of transportation, transportation time is long, so freight management is different. The existing marine logistics transportation management system has many deficiencies in information exchange, cargo management and transportation. The proposal and application of blockchain technology can effectively supplement it. The consensus mechanism is the core of blockchain technology. The decentralized credit structure and the nonoperability of the consensus mechanism of blockchain can effectively overcome the risk of freedom of contract, optimize the maritime logistics and transportation management model, improve the rationality of the sense of responsibility, ensure the transaction efficiency and transportation safety, and comply with the flexible trend of modern maritime trade. This paper introduces the monitoring system and applies it to the management of climate abnormal circulation and marine logistics transportation, which can effectively improve the management of climate abnormal circulation and marine logistics transportation.","https://www.proquest.com/docview/2560320469?accountid=44943&bdid=84593&_bd=bw0s0DfGSNZCcDPXEEdakcKAEYU%3D","https://doi.org/10.1007/s12517-021-07889-4"

Prescription orders are highly customized, and most of them consist of multiple medications that need to be collated before packaging and shipping. The completion time difference between the first and the last medications within the same order is defined as the order collation delay. This research mainly investigates the effects of machine flexibility and the proportion of multi-medication orders on the total collation delays. To solve this NP-hard problem, a genetic algorithm with a min-max Pareto objective function is used. The GA performance is compared to two industry heuristics: the longest processing time (LPT) and the least total workload (LTW). Experimental results indicate that a fully dedicated machine environment has 80 % more total collation delays as compared to a fully flexible machine environment and 25 % more total collation delays as compared to a multi-purpose machine environment.

To be trustworthy, systems need to remain safe while being resilient to unpredictable changes, functional/operational failures and cybersecurity threats. Rigorous validation and verification are essential to ensure trustworthiness of AS. Current engineering practice relies heavily on Verification and Validation (V&V) test-and-fix of system characteristics which is very time-consuming and expensive, limiting the possibilities for exploration of alternatives in system design. Instead, we focus on building a correct-by-construction system. In this paper, we present an approach to identifying and analysing mission requirements for squads of autonomous missions. Clear definition of requirements is an important pre-requisite for mission planning and for V&V of mission management. We use a structured approach to requirements identification and use formal modelling to help remove ambiguities in the requirements and to specify formal properties that should be satisfied by the missions. Our approach use a combination of analysis techniques based on Systems Theoretic Process Analysis (STPA) and formal modelling to generate critical requirements that ensure the safety and security of the system. We also suggest a compositional approach for formal modelling to enhance re-usability and address the complexity of formal modelling. Our approach is being evaluated through consideration of a combined mission of an Unmanned Surface Vehicle (USV) with deployment/recovery of small Unmanned Underwater Vehicles (UUV) within a shipping channel whereby the USV has to safely maintain station for a long period and then proceed to recover the UUV, while maintaining a communication link to an Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV).","https://www.proquest.com/docview/2523164273?accountid=44943&bdid=84593&_bd=pYtIls21ePAtyuL687Yl%2Bx8MB%2Fg%3D","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ssci.2020.105139"

The correlation matrices of the ambient noise spectrum levels offer a promising approach for identifying and isolating the active source mechanisms in ambient noise datasets. This study attempts to use frequency correlation matrices to examine inter-frequency relationships and identify frequency bands that are dominated by specific sources present in samples of ambient noise. Deep-ocean ambient noise recorded by hydroacoustic monitoring systems in the East China Sea and South China Sea was used to analyze the frequency correlation characteristics over a broadband frequency range, with a focus on the contribution of wind-related and shipping-related source mechanisms to the overall ambient noise field at various frequencies. The primary sources observed in both the South China Sea and East China Sea were shipping sources and wind sources. During the observation window, wind was responsible for a significant amount of the ambient noise energy above 477 Hz in the East China Sea, while the corresponding frequency threshold was shifted up to 575 Hz in the South China Sea. Another interesting feature was also observed in the East China Sea: a higher degree of correlation was found between the levels at the wind noise dominated frequencies and mixture noise (mainly consisting of wind noise and shipping noise) dominated frequencies at the upper receiver than at the lower receiver. Data analysis results show that the cause of this effect is that shipping activity contributes more to the soundscape at the lower receiver than at the upper receiver.","https://www.proquest.com/docview/2454746467?accountid=44943&bdid=84593&_bd=f1QzhyhBv8XPwm1m9A%2FgYFQUqko%3D","https://doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2019.2963331"

Much less common, at least in a ports/shipping context, is the attempt to induce supply-chain integration and operational efficiency by direct application of regulatory power and through the intervention of a regulator into the marketplace. In April 2005 the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC), the Australian competition regulator, intervened in the export coal chain which is oriented on the large coal handling terminal at Dalrymple Bay in Queensland. The Commission, through its authorization powers, allowed the terminal operator to introduce a queue management system designed, inter alia, to reduce ship queuing at the terminal and in so doing reduce the costs of ship demurrage and its negative impacts on exports.

Model predictors included industrial, commercial, and institutional/ government/ military land use, roadways, shipping, other transportation sources, and wind rose information. RF generated more accurate models than OLS for most trace elements based on 5-fold cross validation. On average, summer models had the highest cross validation R² (OLS-LUR = 0.40, RF-LUR = 0.46), while fall had the lowest (OLS-LUR = 0.27, RF-LUR = 0.31). Many OLS-LUR models displayed overprediction in the final exposure surface. In contrast, RF-LUR models did not exhibit overpredictions. Taking overpredictions and cross validation performances into account, OLS-LUR performed better than RF-LUR in roughly 20% of the seasonal trace element models. RF-LUR models provided more interpretable predictors in most cases. Seasonal predictors varied, likely due to differences in seasonal distribution of trace elements related to source activity, and meteorology.","https://www.proquest.com/docview/2636681702?accountid=44943&bdid=84593&_bd=m%2Bo38P00hBYEIoKJBrZP3IL1QNY%3D","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2021.150149"

As an alternative approach, we propose here the use of abductive networks, which offer the advantages of simplified and more automated model synthesis and transparent analytical input-output models. Various abductive models for predicting the mean hourly wind speed 1 h ahead have been developed using wind speed data at Dhahran, Saudi Arabia during the month of May over the years 1994-2005. The models were evaluated on the data for May 2006. Models described include a single generic model to forecast next-hour speed from the previous 24 hourly measurements and an hour index, which give an overall mean absolute error (MAE) of 0.85 m/s and a correlation coefficient of 0.83 between actual and predicted values. The model achieves an improvement of 8.2% reduction in MAE compared to hourly persistence. The above model was used iteratively to forecast the hourly wind speed 6 h and 24 h ahead at the end of a given day, with MAEs of 1.20 m/s and 1.42 m/s which are lower than forecasting errors based on day-to-day persistence by 14.6% and 13.7%.

Our focus is to synthesize ship behaviors of interest in a clear and effective way based on automatic preprocessing and analyzing original static AIS data. One improved DBSCAN algorithm is first called to reduce the data scale and discover important data points. Then, from the perspective of Own ship, seven patterns including course change and speed change are defined to be discovered. For each special pattern, the space collision risk DCPA (distance to closest point of approach) and time collision risk TCPA (time to closest point of approach) at the beginning time and ending time are computed to confirm its situation as heading on, crossing, or overtaking with other ships in sight of one another. This unsupervised learning approach will help discover traffic pattern knowledge in current trajectories and provide decision support for future route design or anomaly analysis.","https://www.proquest.com/docview/2133818342?accountid=44943&bdid=84593&_bd=cQlot9BeTyZT0wcpVKL1mgytqvM%3D",""

To meet the requirement of real-time computing for the automated ship loader, the 3D point cloud was first processed to reduce its dimensions from 3D point cloud into a 2D image. A projection method was then applied, to locate and identify all bulk cargo holds in the ship. Finally, a group of experiments on ship identification was conducted, using this algorithm in the Coal Terminal of Tianjin Port.

Data‐driven model selection based on data characteristics is performed through ARIMA, fractional ARIMA (FARIMA), and ARIMA and FARIMA models with GARCH and EGARCH errors. The corresponding machine learning techniques utilized are feed‐forward fully connected artificial neural networks (ANNs), support vector regression (SVR), and multivariate adaptive regression splines (MARS). Among others, FARIMA and MARS models are used for the first time in forecasting the BDI. Diebold–Mariano tests reveal that time series and machine learning approaches have comparable performance.

A port's connectivity is therefore one of the key issues in determining its competitiveness and developments in regions and countries. We construct a port connectivity index for major Norwegian ports based on a unique dataset derived from the automated identification system (AIS) for multiple vessel types over a 7-year period. Port connectivity is evaluated empirically by the number of unique vessel visits, vessel sizes, and cargo sizes. The research has implications for port authorities and policy makers in the areas of port planning, infrastructure investment, short sea shipping promotion, and environmental policies. The contributions of this research are twofold. First, the methodology linking the AIS vessel-tracking system with port connectivity is a pioneering empirical application of maritime big data. Second, the port connectivity index is constructed for multiple vessel types and regional port groups, which is an improvement from the current literature where conceptual measures are constructed based on hypothetical and usually too simple optimization rules.

These terminals involve a large number of complex and combinatorial problems. Two important problems are the container stacking problem and the berth allocation problem. Both problems are generally managed and solved independently but there exist a relationship that must be taken into account to optimize the whole process. The terminal operator normally demands all containers bound for an incoming vessel to be ready in the terminal before its arrival. Similarly, customers (i.e., vessel owners) expect prompt berthing of their vessels upon arrival. This is particularly important for vessels from priority customers who may have been guaranteed berth-on-arrival service in their contract with the terminal operator. To this end, both problems must be interrelated. In this paper, a set of artificial intelligence based-techniques for solving both problems is presented. We develop a planning technique for solving the container stacking problem and a set of optimized allocation algorithms for solving the berth allocation problem independently. Finally we have developed an architecture to solve both problems in an integrated way. Thus, an algorithm for solving the berth allocation problem generates an optimized order of vessels to be served meanwhile our container stacking problem heuristics calculate the minimum number of reshuffles needed to allocate the containers in the appropriate place for the obtained ordering of vessels. Thus combined optimal solutions can be calculated and the terminal operator could decide which solution is more appropriate in each case. These techniques will minimize disruptions and facilitate planning in container terminals.","https://www.proquest.com/docview/1671347830?accountid=44943&bdid=84593&_bd=WVsK9uGgv44M3JJzeLyM4WeMkNY%3D","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.aei.2010.10.001"

This requires measuring potential sailing mobility of coastal sailing runs, as well as direct passages in the open sea. Quantitative works attempting to measure potential sailing mobility have shortcomings related to the use of averaged wind data, thereby losing knowledge of wind variability; non-inclusion of the human factors impacting mobility; and not using methods of measuring coastal sailing. The method presented here was developed to measure potential sailing mobility of coastal sailing runs, based on using the patterns of hourly wind direction and speed variability – and specifically the coastal breeze cycle. The effects of wind variability on sailing mobility are extracted from a large dataset of data at high spatiotemporal resolution, by employing millions of sailing simulations which enable developing meaningful information from big data. This method has demonstrated its applicability to measuring coastal sailing mobility in several developmental case studies in the eastern Mediterranean, introducing realistic measures of mobility that include coefficients of mobility and of time spent waiting for favourable winds. Complementing a previously developed method to measure potential sailing mobility on direct open-sea passages, this new method can now provide a comprehensive toolkit for mapping potential sailing mobility. Such mapping is a valuable input to research on maritime networks and maritime-related developments.","https://www.proquest.com/docview/2636816991?accountid=44943&bdid=84593&_bd=oSfmziEA2li8iNwSjtm78DymAeo%3D","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jas.2021.105500"

The US Global Positioning System (GPS) is currently the primary source of Position, Navigation and Timing (PNT) information in maritime applications, whether stand-alone or augmented with additional systems. This situation will continue in the future with GPS, possibly together with other Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS) e.g. Galileo, being the core PNT technology for e-Navigation - the future digital maritime architecture. GPS signals, measured at the surface on the Earth, are very weak. As such, the system is vulnerable to unintentional interference and jamming, resulting in possible denial of service over large geographical areas. The result of such interference could be the complete failure of the mariner's GPS receiver or, possibly worse, the presentation to the mariner of hazardously misleading information (HMI) for navigation and situational awareness, depending on how the GPS receiver reacts to the jamming incident. Recognising this, the General Lighthouse Authorities of the United Kingdom and Ireland (GLA), in collaboration with the UK Ministry of Defence (MOD) Defence Science and Technology Laboratory (DSTL), have conducted a series of sea-trials with the aim of identifying the full effects of GPS jamming on safe navigation at sea. This paper presents the key findings of these trials and provides important information on the effect of GPS denial. The GLA are playing a pivotal role in the establishment of eLoran as an independent source of PNT, taking advantage of eLoran's complementary nature, having dissimilar failure modes to GPS and the future GNSS. This paper provides information on the performance of an eLoran receiver in an area of GPS service denial. The paper presents the rationale for the work, details the system architecture employed, the data gathering efforts and finally the data analysis procedures, results and conclusions.","https://www.proquest.com/docview/21203769?accountid=44943&bdid=84593&_bd=R5bOUhhHi6FmQLpF6pyMJOIm0uk%3D","https://doi.org/10.1017/S0373463308005213"

Data analysis reveals discrepancies compared to commonly used emission inventories, highlighting missing emissions (e.g. drilling rigs) and the intermittent nature of certain emissions (e.g. flaring, shipping). Present-day shipping/petroleum extraction emissions already appear to be impacting pollutant (ozone, aerosols) levels along the Norwegian coast and are estimated to cool and warm the Arctic climate, respectively. Future increases in shipping may lead to short-term (long-term) warming (cooling) due to reduced sulphur (CO₂) emissions, and be detrimental to regional air quality (ozone).

First, to decrease the possibly existing false alarms from the island, an island filter is used as the first step, and then threshold segmentation is used to quickly perform candidate detection. Second, a two-layer lightweight CNN model-based classifier is built to separate false alarms from the ship object. Finally, we discuss the CNN interpretation and visualize in detail when the ship is predicted in vertical–horizontal (VH) and vertical–vertical (VV) polarization.

Then the problem was overcome by the widespread introduction of automation allowing substantial reductions in manning to be made. In the following decades, ships continued to be automated at an increasing rate with the introduction of periodically unattended machinery spaces and integrated bridge control systems which facilitated `one man on watch' operations so that today, in some ships, there are crews numbering as few as six. The manpower shortage identified in the future is unlikely to be overcome by a further slimming of existing crews because it is recognised that the strain placed on the remaining crew will compromise effectiveness and safety.

It was found that there is currently no comprehensive monitoring system for the delivery of semen. The entire process “shipping of boar semen” was documented using Business Process Model and Notation (BPMN). Although it is not currently known which vibrations occur at all, it is suspected that vibration emissions affect the quality of boar semen. For this reason, a prototype of a measuring system was developed to calculate a displacement index (Di), representing vibration intensities. Vibrations were analyzed in standardized road trials (n = 120) on several road types (A: smooth asphalt pavement, B: rough asphalt pavement, C: cobblestone, and D: dirt road) with different speeds (30, 60, 90, 120, and 150 km/h). A two-way ANOVA showed significant differences in mean Di, depending on road surface and speed as well as an interaction of both factors (p < 0.001). A field study on a reference delivery from a German AI center to several sow farms indicated that 33% of the observed roads are in good quality and generate only a few vibrations (Di ≤ 1), while 40% are of a moderate quality with interrupted surfaces (Di = 1−1.5). However, 25% of the roads show markedly increased vibrations (Di ≥ 1.5), as a consequence of bad conditions on cobblestones or unpaved roads. Overall, more attention should be paid to factors affecting sperm quality during transport. In the future, an Internet of Things (IoT) based solution could enable complete monitoring of the entire transport process in real time, which could influence the courier’s driving behavior based on road conditions in order to maintain the quality of the transported AI doses.","https://www.proquest.com/docview/2671271374?accountid=44943&bdid=84593&_bd=PwIxUHxbHbOgBCiUajqxTa2wJe0%3D","https://doi.org/10.3390/ani12101331"

Selecting the right suppliers and establishing proper ordering and shipping systems are important to reduce unnecessary resource loss and improve the core competitiveness of enterprises. However, most scenarios for supplier selection, order allocation, and transportation solution selection remain largely unknown, particularly in the context of big data. To overcome this problem, this study presents a two-level supply chain network. The ranking and selection of suppliers are achieved by constructing a supplier importance measurement index system and establishing an evaluation model with principal component analysis, while combining the greed idea to establish constraint equations for multiple indicators, order allocation to selected suppliers, and finally, the allocation of transportation solutions considering the loss rate of operators. Finally, a real-world example is employed to demonstrate the efficacy of the algorithm.","https://www.proquest.com/docview/2648808985?accountid=44943&bdid=84593&_bd=JoK%2BQlpEpidms7sgCulzDwJFcvw%3D","https://doi.org/10.1155/2022/3118633"

The persistent mission without any human intervention on the battery charge is obtained by means of an on-field wind generator supplying a charge station that adopts resonant wireless power transfer. The objective of the fleet management is to provide the best connectivity over the time considering the variability of both the bandwidth request and the wind energy availability. The optimal management is performed by a system controller adopting reinforcement learning (RL) for deciding the number of drones to take off and, consequently, the instantaneous provided bandwidth. A constant charge time of drone battery represents a key element of the system because this enables to strongly reduce the complexity of the system controller task. To this purpose, an adaptive current control for the charge station is introduced to compensate charge time variabilities due to the coupling factor changes caused by misalignments that can occur between a pad and a drone. The results have highlighted that the RL provides good performance improvement in case of green generation. An important aspect arose from this study is the ability of RL to increase the saved energy even if it is not considered as a target of the controller.","https://www.proquest.com/docview/2400496286?accountid=44943&bdid=84593&_bd=SKCaP6gNYkUZkfFD7Hwm30ailZ8%3D","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.apenergy.2019.114204"

To speed up the detection process, the optimized histograms of oriented gradients (HOG) algorithm that can avoid the large number of double calculations of the original HOG and ignore insignificant features is used to describe the contour of the human body in real time. Based on the HOG features, using a training sample set consisting of scene images of a bulk port, a support vector machine (SVM) classifier combined with the AdaBoost classifier is trained to detect human. Finally, the results of the human detection experiments on Tianjin Port show that the accuracy of the proposed optimized algorithm has roughly the same accuracy as a traditional algorithm, while the proposed algorithm only takes 1/7 the amount of time.

USVs can either be deployed as a single unit or multiple vehicles in a fleet to conduct ocean missions. Central to the control of USV and USV formations, path planning is the key technology that ensures the navigation safety by generating collision free trajectories. Compared with conventional path planning algorithms, the deep reinforcement learning (RL) based planning algorithms provides a new resolution by integrating a high-level artificial intelligence. This work investigates the application of deep reinforcement learning algorithms for USV and USV formation path planning with specific focus on a reliable obstacle avoidance in constrained maritime environments. For single USV planning, with the primary aim being to calculate a shortest collision avoiding path, the designed RL path planning algorithm is able to solve other complex issues such as the compliance with vehicle motion constraints. The USV formation maintenance algorithm is capable of calculating suitable paths for the formation and retain the formation shape robustly or vary shapes where necessary, which is promising to assist with the navigation in environments with cluttered obstacles. The developed three sets of algorithms are validated and tested in computer-based simulations and practical maritime environments extracted from real harbour areas in the UK.","https://www.proquest.com/docview/2455638254?accountid=44943&bdid=84593&_bd=38QvKEr%2FAIrgWatIx2FqT0tunWI%3D","https://doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2019.2953326"

The emerging digital technologies and Artificial Intelligence (AI) are expected to augment the decision making in Asset Management (AM) and Fleet Management (FM). The AI technologies need to be adapted to the specific needs of any industrial domain, e.g. railways, to facilitate the implementation and achievement of the overall business goals. This adaptation is denoted as ‘Industrial AI’(IAI). IAI for railways infrastructure and rolling stock, is dependent on an appropriate technology roadmap reflecting necessary know-hows. The IAI roadmap aims to provide a strategic and executive plan to augment managing railway assets i.e. ‘Augmented Asset Management (AAM)’. AAM can be applied through an end-to-end secure platform for e.g. data sharing among stakeholders, the development of analytics, and model sharing through distributed computing. AAM in railways can be enhanced through implementation of a generic fleet management (FM) approach. In the FM approach, any population of assets with common characteristics and also the relationship of the asset to the fleet is considered. This paper aims to develop and propose a concept for AAM enabled through IAI and digital technologies to provide augmented decision support through a secure platform, for AM in railways. A FM approach towards a holistic operation and maintenance of assets, based on a System of Systems thinking, for AAM in railways is applied for population of infrastructure assets and rolling stock assets with common characteristics. Finally, a taxonomy of issues and challenges, in the application of AAM to FM in railways is provided. The data for this taxonomy has been collected from railway organizations through iterative rounds of interviews. This taxonomy can be used for research and development of frameworks, approaches, technologies, and methodologies for AAM in railways.","https://www.proquest.com/docview/2688448002?accountid=44943&bdid=84593&_bd=VPAkPHKNqkl8l2GWhHtU15htRHk%3D","https://doi.org/10.1177/09544097211045782"

Using the survey data, we investigate the key factors that affect the bike-sharing adoption of college students through Structural equation modelling and Index score of variables. Other than the conclusions that in line with previous researches, our results indicate that: 1) The service quality dominates the positive effects on college students’ adoption intention of bike-sharing, but its index score is relatively low. Thus, more resources should be concentrated to promote the service quality. The timely maintenance, the ride comfort and the better customer service are the key aspects need to be further improved; 2) The access cost, especially the high deposit, is surprisingly found the main barrier to bike-sharing usage. These findings suggest that cancelling the deposit and employing credit rating based on big data instead, can be a win-win strategy to protect the security of transactions as well as further secure the patronage of college students.

At the core of the system are discrete choice models for shippers and carriers along with a profit maximization model. The discrete choice models predict the acceptance or rejection of an offer for a shipment to shippers and a bid for capacity to carriers. The profit maximization model determines the shipper price that maximizes the 3PL provider's expected profit.

Nevertheless, when it comes to maritime scenarios, the application of IoT and networks of distributed sensors and actuators are still limited, even though the development of marine electronics and extreme network technologies are present for decades also in this area. In this paper, we first introduce the concept of the Internet of Floating Things (IoFT), which extends the IoT to the maritime scenario. Next, we present our latest implementation of the DYNAMO (Distributed leisure Yachts sensor Network for Atmosphere and Marine Observations) system, a framework for coastal data collection from sensors and devices deployed in marine equipment. To demonstrate the importance of IoFT data collection in the real-world environmental science context, we consider a scientific workflow for coastal water quality. The selected application focuses on predicting the spatial and temporal pattern of sea pollutants and their possible presence and time of persistence in the proximity of mussel farm areas in the Bay of Pozzuoli in Italy. The pollutants are simple Lagrangian particles, so the ocean dynamics play an important role in the simulation. Our results show that integrating crowdsourced bathymetry data in the workflow numerical model setup improves the accuracy of the final results, allowing for a more detailed spatial distribution pattern of the sea current driving the Lagrangian tracers.","https://www.proquest.com/docview/2454429304?accountid=44943&bdid=84593&_bd=MHhFzXRt4sjbN1mqxrIdeqdx7u0%3D","https://doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2020.2996778"

We attempt to find the optimal path for vessels in the ocean by proposing an online learning dispatch approach on studying the mission–executing–feedback (MEF) model. The proposed approach explores the ocean subdomain (OS) to achieve the largest average traveling feedback for different vessels. It balances the ocean path by a deep and wide search, and considers adaptation for these vessels. Further, we propose a contextual multiarmed bandit-based algorithm, which provides accurate exploration results with sublinear regret and significantly improves the learning speed.

Aggregated vehicle data can provide “data blanketing” of every street throughout the city, while monitoring vehicle parameters such as vehicle speed, RPM, idle time, fuel usage, location and CO2 emissions. Gathering such data is referred to as Vehicle Telematics, and can be obtained through On-Board Units and AVL (Automatic Vehicle Location) devices. This work aims to compare and evaluate two well-known standards for extracting this vehicle information. Both OBDII and FMS standards are widely used for fleet management and monitoring driving behavior.

When completed, this ground system will provide command and control of four SMEX missions and will demonstrate fleet automation and control concepts. As a path-finder for future mission consolidation efforts, this ground system will also demonstrate new ground-based technologies that show promise of supporting longer mission lifecycles and simplifying component integration.

The detection algorithm is developed using one month of collocated GOES-16 Advanced Baseline Imager (ABI) channel-4 (1.378 μm) radiance and CALIOP 0.532-μm column-integrated cloud optical depth (COD). First, the relationships between the clear-sky 1.378-μm radiance, viewing/solar geometry, and precipitable water vapor (PWV) are characterized. Using machine-learning techniques, it is shown that the total atmospheric pathlength, proxied by airmass factor (AMF), is a suitable replacement for viewing zenith and solar zenith angles alone, and that PWV is not a significant problem over ocean. Detection thresholds are computed using the channel-4 radiance as a function of AMF. The algorithm detects nearly 50% of subvisual cirrus (COD < 0.03), 80% of transparent cirrus (0.03 < COD < 0.3), and 90% of opaque cirrus (COD > 0.3). Using a conservative radiance threshold results in 84% of cloudy pixels being correctly identified and 4% of clear-sky pixels being misidentified as cirrus. A semiquantitative COD retrieval is developed for GOES ABI based on the observed relationship between CALIOP COD and 1.378-μm radiance. This study lays the groundwork for a more complex, operational GOES transparent cirrus detection algorithm. Future expansion includes an overland algorithm, a more robust COD retrieval that is suitable for assimilation purposes, and downstream GOES products such as cirrus cloud microphysical property retrieval based on ABI infrared channels.","https://www.proquest.com/docview/2675655017?accountid=44943&bdid=84593&_bd=XurqWF9Pg1OFlCqyARNpnjK5cV0%3D","https://doi.org/10.1175/JTECH-D-20-0130.1"

MTB are found in chemically-stratified aquatic sediments and/or water columns with a wide range of salinities, moderate to high temperatures, and pH varying from neutral to strongly alkaline. MTB from very cold environments have not been investigated to any great degree and here we characterize MTB from the low temperature Antarctic maritime region. Sediment samples were collected at nine sampling sites within Admiralty Bay, King George Island (62 degree 23'S 58 degree 27'W) from 2009 to 2013. Samples from five sites contained MTB and those from two of these sites contained large number of magnetotactic cocci that were studied using electron microscopy and molecular techniques. The magnetotactic cocci contained magnetosomes either arranged as two or four chains or as a disorganized cluster. The crystalline habit and composition of all magnetosomes analyzed with high-resolution transmission electron microscopy and energy dispersive X-ray microanalysis were consistent with elongated prismatic crystals of magnetite (Fe sub(3)O sub(4)). The retrieved 16S rRNA gene sequences from magnetically-enriched magnetotactic cocci clustered into three distinct groups affiliated with the Alphaproteobacteria class of the Proteobacteria. Novel sequences of each phylogenetic cluster were confirmed using fluorescent in situ hybridization. Metagenomic data analysis of magnetically-enriched magnetotactic cocci revealed the presence of mam genes and MTB-specific hypothetical protein coding genes. Sequence homology and phylogenetic analysis indicated that predicted proteins are related to those of cultivated alphaproteobacterial MTB. The consistent and continuous low temperature of the sediment where the magnetotactic cocci are present (always below 1 degree C) suggests that these MTB from maritime Antarctica are psychrophiles. Moreover, similar morphotypes and 16S gene sequences were retrieved from samples collected from different sites from maritime Antarctica for several years suggesting that these new strains of MTB are indigenous members of Antarctic microbiota.","https://www.proquest.com/docview/1859487906?accountid=44943&bdid=84593&_bd=IwkNdRB%2FTWgXA3EWxVv9drFopJI%3D","https://doi.org/10.1111/1462-2920.13388"

Unfortunately, advancement in automation and technology have not minimised human error as intended. Interaction between humans and technology in the industry is also overtly pre-scripted. The main reason for this is to reduce human error by ensuring predictability in interaction. Ultimately, investigations of non-routine interaction are often based on a hindsight view of what went wrong in a given situation. This article analyses a collection of non-routine interactions that derive from a larger data corpus, using Discursive Psychology and Conversation Analysis. It argues that such a study can capture what is missing from some investigations, namely, what makes sense for crews in the context of a given non-routine situation. Despite the constraints and the challenges of technological complexity, this article argues that reframing psychological matters in non-routine technologically mediated interaction can be a new way of showing how such matters are dynamic, visible and manageable. This can inform the general debate of how to minimise human error, and more specifically, provide insight into the increasing inclusion of technology and as a consequence, the equally increasing amount of technologically mediated interaction that we will see in the future.","https://www.proquest.com/docview/2191720681?accountid=44943&bdid=84593&_bd=Qn5e9b%2FCUwcs2GgyadrlSh5vb4Y%3D","https://doi.org/10.1515/text-2019-2023"

This check does not guarantee whether a transaction is fraud or genuine. But if the two addresses match, the transaction can be classified as genuine with a high probability. Else, the transaction is labelled as suspect. A customer usually carries out similar types of transactions in terms of amount, which can be visualized as part of a cluster.

Long-term SWL forecasts, which are conventionally obtained via harmonic analysis, become ineffective when nonperiodic meteorological events predominate. Artificial intelligence combined with other data-processing methods can effectively forecast highly nonlinear and nonstationary inflow patterns by recognizing historical relationships between input and output. These techniques are considerably useful in time-series data predictions. This paper reports the development of a hybrid model to realize accurate multihour SWL forecasting by combining an adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) with wavelet decomposition while using sea-level anomaly (SLA) and wind-shear-velocity components as inputs. Numerous wavelet-ANFIS (WANFIS) models have been tested using different inputs to assess their applicability as alternatives to the artificial neural network (ANN), wavelet ANN (WANN), and ANFIS models. Different error definitions have been used to evaluate results, which indicate that integrated wavelet-decomposition and ANFIS models improve the accuracy of SWL prediction and that the inputs of SLA and wind-shear velocity exhibit superior prediction capability compared to conventional SWL-only models.","https://www.proquest.com/docview/2412164887?accountid=44943&bdid=84593&_bd=pIj1jkx9X6Nf%2FcvZ2IXGvK5%2BPq0%3D","https://doi.org/10.1007/s13131-020-1569-1"

This research work dives into the study of navigators’ navigating patterns (NPs) in a maritime collision-avoidance (CA) traffic situation. Three NPs, specifically conservative, moderate, and aggressive modes, are identified with respect to a collision risk assessment (CRA) by interpreting data collected from the GPS and automatic identification systems. The CRA is realized following the collision risk modeling concept of the closest point of approach. Then, a human-centered onboard guidance-support system is developed according to the patterns identified to help navigators make decisions. This proposed approach is implemented in the scenario of sailing across a narrow strait, where human intelligence remains necessary in the foreseeable future. The research experiment was conducted on Kongsberg maritime simulators. Thirty-six rounds of sailing data containing 108 CA subtasks were collected and analyzed to classify NPs. Afterward, a guidance-support system was designed based on the patterns’ demonstration. An additional experiment to test the developed system in the same scenario was organized on the same simulator. The results show that the system can considerably improve the navigator’s navigation management ability in CA operations.

The concept of the ship domain is of major importance in the assessment of a navigational situation and the avoidance of ship collisions. It is difficult to determine a ship domain as its shape and size depend on a number of factors. One question to be answered before the determination of the ship domain is which method to use: statistical, analytic, or expert method using artificial intelligence tools; other questions are connected with domain interpretation. The authors have analyzed the ship domain as a criterion for the assessment of ship navigational safety in an encounter situation in the open sea. The research results are used to answer some of the questions. Part 2 includes definitions of the ship domain and ship fuzzy domain. Part 3, in turn, presents methods of their determination as well as relevant questions. The results of the authors' research, described in Part 4, make up a basis for the determination of the domain and ship fuzzy domain. These have been determined with the so-called dynamic domains as a point of departure. The criteria of ship domain and closest point of approach are compared and discussed. Encounters of various size ships are considered in Part 5. The research and its results are described. Both ship domains and ship fuzzy domains of encountering ships are analyzed. Then, conclusions have been formulated in relation to the effect of the sizes of encountering ships on the shapes and sizes of their domains. Final conclusions are given in Part 6.","https://www.proquest.com/docview/21198328?accountid=44943&bdid=84593&_bd=Folk%2FYdmc2SeFFlVbyiqn9CXVgM%3D","https://doi.org/10.1017/S0373463308005018"

To this end, DNVGL COSSMOS (Complex Ship Systems Modelling and Simulation) in-house process modelling framework is used to build digital twins of the propulsion and cargo module of LNG carriers, modelling the entire energy conversion process from cargo tanks to useful energy required for propulsion, electricity and heat. Emphasis is given on reliquefaction systems and the improvement they provide in performance, comparing the currently available technologies and giving deeper insight for the Joule-Thomson systems. The overall ship system performance is improved by 5–15% along the low vessel speed range and 25–40% for the anchorage loaded port condition, when partial reliquefaction systems are considered, depending on the configuration they are compared to. Engine technology also plays an important role, with high-pressure engines exhibiting 3–10% better performance, depending on the reliquefaction technology coupled with, along the high vessel speed range, mainly because of their inherent better performance.","https://www.proquest.com/docview/2441309974?accountid=44943&bdid=84593&_bd=pj76OGdyinpDA54oWKdycwIVqxM%3D","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.energy.2020.116997"

High strain rate transient bending produced by such loads may result in failure of fine pitch electronic interconnects. Current experimental techniques rely on electrical resistance for determination of failure. Significant advantage can be gained by prior knowledge of impending failure for applications where the consequences of system failure may be catastrophic. This research effort focuses on an alternate approach to damage quantification in electronic assemblies subjected to shock and vibration, without testing for electrical continuity. The proposed approach can be extended to monitor product level damage. In this paper, statistical pattern recognition and leading indicators of shock damage have been used to study the damage initiation and progression in shock and drop of electronic assemblies. Statistical pattern recognition is currently being employed in a variety of engineering and scientific disciplines such as biology, psychology, medicine, marketing, artificial intelligence, computer vision, and remote sensing . The application quantification of shock damage in electronic assemblies is new. Previously, free vibration of rectangular plates has been studied by various researchers for development of analytical closed form models. In this paper, closed form models have been developed for the eigen frequencies and mode shapes of electronic assemblies with various boundary conditions and component placement configurations. Model predictions have been validated with experimental data from modal analysis. Pristine configurations have been perturbed to quantify the degradation in confidence values with progression of damage. Sensitivity of leading indicators of shock damage to subtle changes in boundary conditions, effective flexural rigidity, and transient strain response has been quantified. A damage index for experimental damage monitoring has been de- veloped using the failure indicators. The above damage monitoring approach is not based on electrical continuity and hence can be applied to any electronic assembly structure irrespective of the interconnections. The damage index developed provides parametric damage progression data, thus removing the limitation of current failure testing, where the damage progression cannot be monitored. Hence the proposed method does not require the assumption that the failure occurs abruptly after some number of drops and can be extended to product level drops.","https://www.proquest.com/docview/875069617?accountid=44943&bdid=84593&_bd=ivo8vjpvcjfM%2BkuC4IqDE%2BxyXSo%3D","https://doi.org/10.1109/TCAPT.2008.916853"

It is a part of the optical wireless communications research area, since for these applications, broad optical sources such as visible LED lamps can be used. Unless those links are designed for short distances (about 1 m, as in data-muling services on internet-of-things submerged systems), they are still severely affected by channel perturbations, such as scattering due to the presence of particles. This effect is particularly important when considering sensing applications for algae or aquaculture farming, which are becoming a crucial economic resource in many maritime areas. In this work, the effects of moving microalgae on underwater short-range optical links are studied so as to estimate a model for this scattering under dynamic conditions. The statistical parameters over experimentally measured received signal level and signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) are calculated, and the experimental setup is described. Results show that in clear water (no-algae scenario), the water-pump-induced movement effect over the mean and variance of the received optical power can be neglected, while when microalgae are present, the average optical power value decreases and the variance increases with all measured wavelengths. Finally, the SNR penalty due to the movement of microalgae is statistically evaluated.","https://www.proquest.com/docview/2339029636?accountid=44943&bdid=84593&_bd=3U4YzQ1lxsaG2qqxDSbJrThxVwA%3D","https://doi.org/10.1364/AO.379436"

Forty healthy male study participants were enrolled in Pittsburgh and Los Angeles. MMC were isolated from rectal biopsies using the same biopsy acquisition and enzymatic digestion protocols. As an additional comparator, peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) were collected from the study participants. For quality control, cryopreserved PBMC from a single donor were supplied to both sites from a central repository (qPBMC). Using a jointly optimized standard operating procedure, cells were isolated from tissue and blood and stained with monoclonal antibodies targeted to T cell phenotypic markers. Site-specific flow data were analyzed by an independent center which analyzed all data from both sites. Ranges for frequencies for overall CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, derived from the qPBMC samples, were equivalent at both UCLA and MWRI. However, there were significant differences across sites for the majority of T cell activation and memory subsets in qPBMC as well as PBMC and MMC. Standardized protocols to collect, stain, and analyze MMC and PBMC, including centralized analysis, can reduce but not exclude variability in reporting flow data within multi-site studies. Based on these data, centralized processing, flow cytometry, and analysis of samples may provide more robust data across multi-site studies. Centralized processing requires either shipping of fresh samples or cryopreservation and the decision to perform centralized versus site processing needs to take into account the drawbacks and restrictions associated with each method.","https://www.proquest.com/docview/1762369349?accountid=44943&bdid=84593&_bd=oIK77f05UmVjVGdFych8D48g7q8%3D","https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0126454"

The paper presents investigations on the modernisation of river convoys adapted to the current navigational conditions of the Lower Vistula. The different options have been discussed by the authors with river fleet operators and the best recognised solution was agreed to be the use of river convoys combining modernised motor barges and the pushed barges previously used in this area. Improvement of the transport profitability, reduction of fuel consumption, air pollution and noise can be achieved at minimum costs by modernisation of the main power-propulsion systems of outdated motor barges and the implementation of innovative steering systems on pushed barges.

We causally estimate the impact of chatbot anthropomorphism on transaction conversion by randomly exposing consumers to exogenously varied levels of chatbot anthropomorphism, operationalized by incorporating a random draw from a set of three anthropomorphic features: humor, communication delays, and social presence. We provide evidence that, in this retail setting, anthropomorphism is beneficial for transaction outcomes, but that it also leads to significant increases in offer sensitivity. We argue that the latter effect occurs because, as a chatbot becomes more human-like, consumers shift to a fairness evaluation or negotiating mindset. We also provide descriptive evidence suggesting that the benefits of anthropomorphism for transaction conversion may derive, at least in part, from consumers' increased willingness to disclose personal information necessary to complete the transaction.","https://www.proquest.com/docview/2582857026?accountid=44943&bdid=84593&_bd=RLa4bsRW35AisqdORKcEAPrV%2BhA%3D","https://doi.org/10.1287/isre.2021.1015"

In order to achieve this goal, the solution uses the knowledge acquired by the company drivers to propose optimised routes. Hence, the proposed solution gathers the experience of the drivers, processes it and optimises the delivery process. The solution uses data mining to extract knowledge from the company information systems and prepares it for analysis with a case-based reasoning (CBR) algorithm. The CBR obtains critical business intelligence knowledge from the drivers experience that is needed by the planner. The design of the routes is done by a genetic algorithm that, given the processed information, optimises the routes following several objectives, such as minimise the distance or time. Experimentation shows that the proposed approach is able to find routes that improve, on average, the routes made by the human experts.","https://www.proquest.com/docview/1669893000?accountid=44943&bdid=84593&_bd=rhWKIV0mtSYhzWQ%2Bsxx4T4Sgpc0%3D","https://doi.org/10.1080/17517575.2012.759279"

In 1971 a Maritime Administration (MarAd) Advisory Group recognized a void in the area of computer aided shipbuilding. In response, MarAd acquired rights to the AUTOKON-71 system, the most widely used system in Europe. MarAd and the participating shipyards recognized the need to provide maintenance and support for the AUTOKON system. That effort was sponsored and paid for jointly by the industrial users and the government. It soon became apparent to all concerned that there was much more to be gained from computer applications in the shipyard than just running the AUTOKON system. A total shipyard program for computer automation beyond AUTOKON was needed. It was this decision that gave birth to the Research and Engineering for Automation and Productivity in Shipbuilding (REAPS) program; a joint participation program involving five shipyards, MarAd, and IITRI. Its purpose was to identify and address common problems in ship construction. The advantages were obvious. Participants could pool both the technological know how in identifying and solving problems and their resources to solve a common problem only once not repetitively at every shipyard. The REAPS program, a new concept in cooperative developments among several shipyards, was working. One thing began to change-the objectives of our development projects. Originally, they were oriented to a specific computer system, AUTOKON; now they were becoming non-system oriented, standalone modules with no relationship to a specific computer system or software package. A new concept was needed. The 'new' REAPS program as it has evolved to date is a non-systems oriented program with the separation of all AUTOKON related activities. The overall concept of the new REAPS Program consists of five basic elements: Advance Planning, Technology Assessment, Development Program, Technology Information Services and Discretionary Development.","https://www.proquest.com/docview/21540861?accountid=44943&bdid=84593&_bd=UBNFBkQERPCAhJTuaF6H7ZHHuEA%3D",""

Nevertheless, many deep learning methods cannot deal with the special needs of Internet of Things, for example, the Internet of vehicles and ships for the traffic haze image. Particularly, haze removal in the water area, because of the influence of water vapor, is more difficult than that in the ordinary scene. And the dehazing of water area has practical value in shipping and aerial photography. Sensible dehazing effect can even ensure the safety of navigation. In this paper, a compensation textures dehazing method is presented for water alike scene. The motivation of this paper comes from the following observations. Dark channel haze removal method has a very real dehazing effect for ordinary scenes. However, due to the principle of the dark channel method, this dehazing method has a large deviation in the water alike area. Therefore, based on the classical dark channel method, this paper proposes three innovations. First, a dynamic priority method is designed. This method can calculate the priority order of patches according to the characteristics of the processed subject. Second, a compensation textures method is designed, which can compensate the special area according to the proposed priority method. Third, a new haze removal method is designed, which can effectively remove the haze of water area according to the proposed compensation textures method. The results of visual and quality experiment show that proposed method has a state-of-the-art dehazing result in the water alike area.","https://www.proquest.com/docview/2500467700?accountid=44943&bdid=84593&_bd=9S0XYWwAGAv11hmUhQFMfFbuO2s%3D","https://doi.org/10.1007/s11227-020-03406-8"

Defined as one of the three key services in 5th Generation (5G), massive Machine Type Communications (mMTC) are intended to enable the wide-spread adoption of IoT services across the globe. Satellite-based Non-Terrestrial Networks (NTN) are crucial in providing connectivity with global coverage including rural and offshore areas, which are fundamental for supporting important use cases in future networks. A rapidly growing market for IoT devices with mMTC applications using NarrowBand-IoT (NB-IoT) will represent a large share of user equipment (UE) in such areas. While standardization efforts for NTN are underway for forthcoming 3GPP releases, they focus on transparent payload architectures where the satellite platform is necessarily connected to a ground station gateway to be able to provide satellite access services to IoT devices, thus requiring complex ground segment infrastructure in low Earth orbit (LEO) constellation deployments to achieve global coverage. In contrast, satellite network deployments targeting the delivery of delay-tolerant IoT applications using NB-IoT, which are a major mMTC use case, can benefit from architectures based on the use of regenerative payloads in the satellite and support for Store and Forward (S&F) operation where satellite access can remain operational even at times when the satellite is not connected to a ground station. In particular, such an approach would allow for extending satellite service coverage in areas where satellites cannot be connected to ground stations (e.g. maritime or very remote areas with lack of ground-stations infrastructures), improving ground segment affordability by enabling operation with fewer ground-stations and allowing more robust operation of the satellite under intermittent feeder link operation. In this paper, we provide a high-level design of an extended 3GPP architecture featuring store and forward mechanisms for IoT NTN delay-tolerant applications that address the previous challenges, as well as a laboratory validation of said architecture for a specific use case.","https://www.proquest.com/docview/2688690407?accountid=44943&bdid=84593&_bd=eHbM%2FaduyVA2efd5ZMeEMe9uFaM%3D","https://doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2022.3184720"

A machine learning approach was used to understand the most influential environmental variables that may explain current species distribution and productivity. Background and Objectives: The aims of the study were: (1) to map species potential suitability areas using ecological envelopes in the present and to project them in the future under climate change scenarios; (2) to map species current distributions; (3) to map species current productivity; and (4) to explore the most influential environmental variables on species current distribution and productivity. Materials and Methods: Climate, elevation data, and soil data sets were used to obtain present and future species ecological envelopes under two climate change scenarios. The official land cover maps were used to map species distributions. Forest inventory data were used to map the species productivity by geostatistical techniques. A Bayesian machine learning approach, supported by species distributions and productivity data, was used to explore the most influential environmental variables on species distribution and productivity and to validate species ecological envelopes. Results: The species ecological envelope methodology was found to be robust. Species’ ecological envelopes showed a high potential for both species’ afforestation. In the future, a decrease in the country’s area potentiality was forecasted for both species. The distribution of maritime pine was found to be mainly determined by precipitation-related variables, but the elevation and temperature-related variables were very important to differentiate species productivity. For eucalypts, species distribution was mainly explained by temperature-related variables, as well as the species productivity. Conclusions: These findings are key to support recommendations for future afforestation and will bring value to policy-makers and environmental authorities in policy formulation under climate change scenarios.","https://www.proquest.com/docview/2467654768?accountid=44943&bdid=84593&_bd=QZT4kdU7Y%2F%2F4bXqQwR4csLeIkVA%3D","https://doi.org/10.3390/f11080880"

In the seawater temperature profile measurement system established in this study, the seawater temperature profile data measured by multiple sensors in a sea pond in the cold region of the Bohai Sea were collected through LabVIEW programming, and the real-time data were released to the Internet through the data transfer unit (DTU) module and remotely stored on the server. In this way, the real-time monitoring of the under-ice seawater temperature profile of Liaodong Bay was realized by the Internet of Things. Then the variations of seawater temperature at different depths in the observation area in different sea ice growth stages were analyzed. The overall fluctuation of water temperature at different depths was relatively flat and basically consistent with the changing trend of air temperature. The water temperature at the bottom of the sea pond varied greatly. The continuous air temperature decrease in winter led to seawater icing. Underwater temperature rose slowly as a result of heat release during the seawater icing process. These data and conclusions provide the basis for this study on the prediction methods of the freezing and melting processes of sea ice in Liaodong Bay.

Here, we present evidence from an atmospheric general circulation model (AGCM) forced by the history of observed sea surface temperature (SST) that the Walker Circulation may have intensified rather than weakened. Observed Equatorial Indo-Pacific Sector SST since 1870 exhibited a zonally asymmetric evolution: While the eastern part of the Equatorial Pacific showed only a weak warming, or even cooling in one SST dataset, the western part and the Equatorial Indian Ocean exhibited a rather strong warming. This has resulted in an increase of the SST gradient between the Maritime Continent and the eastern part of the Equatorial Pacific, one driving force of the Walker Circulation. The ensemble experiments with the AGCM, with and without time-varying external forcing, suggest that the enhancement of the SST gradient drove an anomalous atmospheric circulation, with an enhancement of both Walker and Hadley Circulation. Anomalously strong precipitation is simulated over the Indian Ocean and anomalously weak precipitation over the western Pacific, with corresponding changes in the surface wind pattern. Some sensitivity to the forcing SST, however, is noticed. The analysis of twentieth century integrations with global climate models driven with observed radiative forcing obtained from the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP) database support the link between the SST gradient and Walker Circulation strength. Furthermore, control integrations with the CMIP models indicate the existence of strong internal variability on centennial timescales. The results suggest that a radiatively forced signal in the Walker Circulation during the twentieth century may have been too weak to be detectable.","https://www.proquest.com/docview/1017978791?accountid=44943&bdid=84593&_bd=b00wao4ek930NFcdImciQKt5QgE%3D","https://doi.org/10.1007/s00382-011-1047-8"

In a warning context, being able to provide localized tsunami forecasts at strategic locations would therefore help mitigate the damage. Despite the recent advancements in computing powers and the development of highly efficient tsunami codes, capturing this local variability can oftentimes be infeasible in a warning setting. Traditional high‐resolution simulations which can capture these localized effects are often too costly to run “on‐the‐fly.” Alternative approaches that capture the localized response to an incoming tsunami, which are based upon using the maximum wave heights from a computationally cheap regional forecast, are developed here. These alternative approaches are envisaged to aid in a warning center's ability at providing extremely rapid localized forecasts. The approaches focus upon two different methods: transfer functions and machine learning techniques. The transfer function is based upon a recent extension to the established Green's Law. The extended version introduces local amplification parameters, with the aim of capturing the neglected localized effects. An automated approach which optimizes for these local amplification parameters is outlined and the performance of the transfer function is explored. A machine learning model is also trained and used to predict the localized tsunami hazard. Its performance is compared to the extended Green's Law approach for a site along the French coast. These developed methods showcase promising techniques that a tsunami warning center could use to provide high‐resolution warnings.","https://www.proquest.com/docview/2684224394?accountid=44943&bdid=84593&_bd=jjZJZ%2Bk9z6C6QiQQFNBpsNsPI%2BM%3D","https://doi.org/10.1029/2022JC018467"

Sending and storing such vehicle trajectory data cause sustainable communication and storage overheads. Trajectory data compression becomes a promising way to alleviate overhead issues. However, previous solutions are commonly carried out at the side of the data center after data having been received, thus saving the storage cost only. Here, we bring the idea of mobile edge computing and transfer the computation-intensive data compression task to the mobile devices of drivers. As a result, the trajectory data is reduced at the side of data generators before being sent out; thus, it can lower data communication and storage costs simultaneously. We propose DAVT , an error-bounded trajectory data representation, and a compression framework. Specifically, the trajectory data is reformatted into three parts (i.e., D istance, A cceleration & V elocity, and T ime), and three compressors are wisely devised to compress each part. For D and AV parts, a similar Huffman tree-forest structure is exploited to encode data elements effectively, but with quite different rationales. For the T part, the large absolute timestamps are transformed to small time intervals firstly, and different encoding techniques are adopted based on the data quality.

It can meet the needs of network resources for maritime activities and remote mountainous areas, which is of great significance to the realization of a new generation of communications networks. With the development of the network and the emergence of delay-sensitive applications such as the Internet of Things, improving the delay performance of the system has received extensive attention. SAGIN involves multiple networks and is more complex than other networks. If there is no reasonable management between different networks, it is easy to lead to difficult link deployment and high time delay. On the basis of research and customization of SFC technology, it can provide a wide range of services and other advantages. It has significant performance in application scenarios involving multi network integration. In order to solve the above problems, this paper studies the SAGIN architecture of SFC based on business types. A service function chain mapping method based on delays prediction is proposed. Calculate the delay of the deployment path and select the path with the lowest delay as the SFC mapping path. The service model is constructed according to the mapping path, and the network slices are divided based on the service type.

Expanding the role of a multifunctional radar into a multifunctional radio frequency system (MFRFS), incorporating functions such as wireless communications and electronic warfare, has the potential to offer significant benefits. Technologies such as direct RF digitization, AI resource management, and high bandwidth amplifiers could enable a future MFRFS to fulfil these functions. Multifunctionality must be a key design driver when procuring MFRFSs; however, this runs counter to the traditional approach of requiring an assured minimum performance of a single function—while a particular system based around an individual function could potentially outperform the MFRFS, the overall performance across all functions should be better than the performance of a collection of individual systems.","https://www.proquest.com/docview/2647428012?accountid=44943&bdid=84593&_bd=I2jTTs5OsJUUNI%2BNHWd%2FKxVi7eQ%3D","https://doi.org/10.1109/MAES.2021.3081168"

By using Fuzzy C-Means (FCM), it is possible to construct an artificial intelligence to classify and identify ARPA target types and calculate the possibility of a target being a real vessel based on the target's speed over ground, vector over ground, and location. The membership functions of each attribute are constructed using statics, expert knowledge, and electronic chart information. The main difficulty in developing a successful FCM framework to achieve the previously stated goals is the determination of a proper method of calculating the classification number C and fuzzy coefficient m. Because the value of C for the case of ARPA targets classification is finite, the best C would be determined by assessing the Euclidean distance. The value of m is related to the discreteness of the evidence and results, which is evaluated using the Shannon entropy and the gain. A number of methods exist to properly evaluate the contributions from different forms of evidence so that the best m can be found using the tendentiousness of the evidence. In field testing, the improved FCM was able to accurately classify the ARPA targets, decrease the workload on the ship's officer, and increase safety.","https://www.proquest.com/docview/1677945577?accountid=44943&bdid=84593&_bd=GSnmFa0r0Pd6ONunoJkoqrYs9FI%3D","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.trc.2014.12.001"

"GPRS security as a QoS in the telecommunication industry case of Vodafone Egypt","","Kamel, Sherif; Wahba, Khaled","International Journal of Information Management","Scholarly Journals","","24","1","2004-02-01","Feb 2004","5","","5-27","02684012","","","ENG","The changes taking place in the world today are largely due to the developments and evolution in a number of industries; one of which is information and communication technology. Focusing on communications solutions with an emphasis on business applications, it is obvious to claim that business applications that are being deployed with 2.5G wireless networks fall into two general categories: (a) horizontal applications ""mobile office"" such as electronic mailing, voice communications, Internet access, short messaging and personal information management (PIM) tools and (b) vertical applications ""sales force automation""(SFA) and field force automation (FFA), fleet management, government communications and public safety, telemetry and remote monitoring, point-of-sale as well as financial services. The new generation of wireless devices being introduced to the market for 2.5G global system for mobile communications (GSM) and general packet radio service (GPRS) services is designed to support these applications, with features ranging from small standard keyboards to high resolutions rich colored screens. The impressive growth of cellular mobile telephony as well as the number of Internet users promises an exciting potential for a market that combines both innovations.  The general packet radio service (GPRS) is a new non-voice value-added service that allows information to be sent and received across a mobile telephone network. Users of GPRS benefit from shorter access time and higher data rates. It is important to note that the standard GPRS network itself does not offer a reasonably secure solution for providing mobile access to a corporate local area network (LAN). Although, the air interface ciphering and the GPRS authentication process are secured, the IP traffic is unencrypted all the way from the serving GPRS support node (SGSN) to the corporate LAN gateway. The most feasible solution for secure remote connections would be to use an end-to-end virtual private network (VPN) solution from the mobile station (MS) to the corporate LAN gateway where the traffic is encrypted for the whole connection and the user can slip to the Internet from the nearest access point. It is important to separate the user traffic from the control traffic to guarantee high level of security with a minor impact on quality of service (QoS) which means providing consistent and predictable data delivery service that can lead to customer application requirement satisfaction. However, to achieve that security has to be looked at as the key player in the new GSM data networks when deploying GPRS. This paper1 demonstrates the case of Vodafone Egypt, one of the mobile operators, in deploying GPRS networks while focusing on exploring the business opportunities and motivating factors to implement GPRS. Moreover, the paper proposes solutions on how to create secure connections over GPRS networks while proposing a security policy for Vodafone Egypt.

Application of Maritime Autonomous Surface Ship (MASS) requires industries and authorities to think about the trustworthiness of autonomous operation regardless of crew availability on board the ship. Accordingly, this paper aims to prognose the health state of the conventional ships, assuming that it gets through higher ADs. To this end, a comprehensive and structured Hierarchal Bayesian Inference (HBI)-based reliability framework using a machine learning application is proposed. A machinery plant operated in a merchant ship is selected as a case study to indicate the advantages of the developed methodology. Correspondingly, the given main engine in this study can operate for 3, 17, and 47 weeks without human intervention if the ship approaches the autonomy degree of four, three, and two, respectively. Given the deterioration ratio defined in this study, the acceptable transitions from different ADs are specified.

Improvement of field performance through stock quality has been used for decades. Here, we use machine learning (ML) techniques to identify key stock traits involved in successful survival and to refine previous specifications that were developed under more conventional stock quality assessments carried out at the lifting–shipping phases in the nursery. Two differentiated stocklots in each species were used, both fitting in the regional quality standard. ML was used to infer a set of attributes for planted seedlings that were subsequently related to survival at the short-term (two years) and mid-term (ten years) in six different species planted in a harsh site with shallow soil that suffered the driest year on record during this study. Whilst stocklot quality, as measured in the lifting–shipping stage, had very poor importance to the survival response, individual plant traits presented a moderate to high diagnostic ability for seedling survival (area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve between 0.59 and 0.99). Early growth traits catch most of the importance in these models (≈40%), followed by individual morphology traits (≈28%) and site variation (≈2%), with overall means varying across species. Aleppo pine and Phoenician juniper stocklots presented survival rates of 66–78% after ten years, and these rates were below 27% for the remaining species that suffered during the historical drought. In Aleppo pine, the plant attributes related to early field performance (growth in the first growing season) were more important in the drought-mediated mid-term performance than stock quality at the nursery stage. Within the technical framework of this study, our results allow for both testing and refining the regional quality standard specifications for harsh conditions such as those found in our study.","https://www.proquest.com/docview/2675570386?accountid=44943&bdid=84593&_bd=m9SgorjTWDMP%2BpbPJLrsfGLRo5c%3D","https://doi.org/10.3390/f13020168"

Full-scale simulated scenarios were developed and tested on 16 professional vessel traffic service (VTS) operators comparing VTS operations as they are today with the added STM functionality. Data collection involved observations which assessed the frequency and type of interactions between ships and VTS, followed by questionnaires to provide an overall assessment of the user experience. The results indicate that the frequency and method of communication patterns between VTS operators and ships will be affected by the integration of the STM services. Additional access to navigational information could change the role of VTS operators in traffic situations compared with traditional operations.

Exploratory factor analysis and multi-regression analysis were applied for the data analysis.FindingsThere were four primary dimensions relating to seafarers’ management, namely, work attitude, loyalty, payment and welfare and opportunity. The results revealed that dimensions of payment and welfare and opportunity were significantly positive effect on seafarers’ loyalty; only the dimension of payment and welfare was found to significantly effect on the work attitude.

This research, as the first attempt in the literature, aims to render a comprehensive map of the body of knowledge in the carsharing field of research through conducting a systematic bibliometric analysis. To achieve that, a total of 729 peer-reviewed journal articles from the Web of Science database were scrutinized using keyword, text mining, and bibliographic coupling analyses. The analyses revealed four main research themes building the carsharing literature, including (1) collaborative consumption and carsharing business models development in the context of sustainable urban transport, (2) carsharing adoption with a special focus on user behavior, intention, and preferences, (3) carsharing operational challenges, considering infrastructure and fleet management, and (4) technological advancement towards deployment of shared autonomous vehicles and mobility as a service. The results showed that the carsharing literature lacks (i) a well-established and comprehensive long-term sustainability assessment framework, (ii) inclusive and integrative marketing and training plans, as well as effective incentives, (iii) a holistic analysis of the role of carsharing in the achievement of Sustainable Development Goals, (iv) reliable circular economy indicators designed to measure the circularity of carsharing to help transitioning towards a circular economy, and (v) a timely broad analysis on the implications of the COVID-19 pandemic and the future of carsharing post pandemic era, which call for more investigations in the future. The provided insights support both researchers and policy-makers by shedding light on carsharing services research by providing a state-of-the-art of carsharing studies and developments up to date, uncovering the emergent research themes and trends, and identifying research gaps for future studies towards better positioning carsharing services in sustainable cities development.","https://www.proquest.com/docview/2675555707?accountid=44943&bdid=84593&_bd=1e3VlNElef3re%2B%2FGgiTTmakcD1I%3D","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jclepro.2022.131981"

This research investigated the relation between tides, nutrients, and physicochemical properties of water in order to provide the basis to describe the effects of tides in the coastal waters of Port Dickson, a central attraction of the Strait of Malacca. Relatively all of the studied parameters (physicochemical properties and nutrients concentration) showed higher values at low tide than at high tide, except for salinity and electrical conductivity. Relationships between nutrients and physicochemical properties at high and low tides were studied using Spearman correlation analysis. It may be noted that the relationship between nutrients and physicochemical properties at high and low tides varies from weak (r = 0.400) to moderate (r = 0.558). The multivariate statistical technique principal components analysis (PCA) was employed to better interpret information about the interaction between nutrients and physicochemical properties at high and low tides.

Development of risk assessment methods is critical for the future of this business segment. To provide decision support for the management of an autonomous emission control boat, we begin by proposing a k‐Nearest‐Neighbours (k‐NN)‐based trajectory prediction method. This is employed in a bi‐objective routing problem of finding a Hamiltonian circuit in a dynamic network defined by predicted locations of ships over time. The objectives are maximizing the number of measurement tasks to be done and minimizing the corresponding total travel distance of the emission control boat. To evaluate the impact of trajectory prediction uncertainty on Pareto‐optimal itineraries, we propose a risk measure in a mean‐risk framework. The risk is defined based on an expected shortfall when implementation of an efficient itinerary under the predicted trajectories needs rescheduling based on realized trajectories. The risk measure helps the decision maker to evaluate choice alternatives among efficient itineraries under predicted trajectories and to make a balanced risk‐adjusted decision. We show how historical data is employed in integer linear programming for the estimation of such risk measure. Empirical results demonstrate such estimation.","https://www.proquest.com/docview/2486620781?accountid=44943&bdid=84593&_bd=wrKB98LyPdoh4R7E09IAW6f1NIo%3D","https://doi.org/10.1111/itor.12882"

This is not especially surprising given their complexity and the underlying power relationships by which they are structured. Nonetheless, integration that does occur may reflect efforts to re-engineer the chain; or, not unusually, it may be the result of substantial, market-based rationalization and consolidation of the industry through corporate restructuring by merger, acquisition or joint venture. Much less common, at least in a ports/shipping context, is the attempt to induce supply-chain integration and operational efficiency by direct application of regulatory power and through the intervention of a regulator into the marketplace. In April 2005 the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC), the Australian competition regulator, intervened in the export coal chain which is oriented on the large coal handling terminal at Dalrymple Bay in Queensland. The Commission, through its authorization powers, allowed the terminal operator to introduce a queue management system designed, inter alia, to reduce ship queuing at the terminal and in so doing reduce the costs of ship demurrage and its negative impacts on exports. This paper focuses particularly, but not only, on the conceptual relationships between regulation and supply chain efficiency; and it examines the mechanisms, processes and outcomes in the Dalrymple Bay case.","https://www.proquest.com/docview/29912170?accountid=44943&bdid=84593&_bd=T6iSAStSvdKudJdOAMFvpTstYuw%3D","https://doi.org/10.1080/03088830701240029"

The purpose of this paper is to examine the current ship registration situation and particularly the impact of the 2008 financial crisis on flagging behaviour in light of national characteristics. Design/methodology/approach - The paper provides an overview of ship registration over the past 14 years and picks up new trends in the changing global economy. Moreover, a panel data analysis is applied to examine flagging in/out on a state by state basis. Findings - The clear-cut distinction between national registration and open registration has been diminishing and a convergence has been observed between the two flag types. The sovereignty of states creates a set of regulatory niches. The panel data results show that the flagging behaviour varies from nation to nation. A shipowner's view on choice of flag might be affected by national characteristics, and different continents and ship types tend to exert different influences on flagging out. Practical implications - It is an oversimplification to assume the downfall of regulation and the rise of liberal deregulation, as different nations have different roles to play in this globalised maritime arena. At some point, an equilibrium may be established whereby the ratio of flagging out would reach a stable plateau within each nation. Originality/value - This paper identifies the new features of ship registration after the financial crisis. Whereas flagging behaviour has been examined before from many different perspectives, this study approaches the issue from a macroeconomic viewpoint and further elucidates the impact of national states on the globalised phenomenon of the shipping world.","https://www.proquest.com/docview/1671552067?accountid=44943&bdid=84593&_bd=O6ducMNscIFgLNXuVYfsK64db74%3D","https://doi.org/10.1108/IJLM-05-2013-0056"

In this paper, a random forest (RF)-based approach is provided so as to assess the severity and risk of NTS events in sea lanes. Data was manually collected from the Global Integrated Shipping Information System (GISIS) and first classified into four severity levels, according to the classification criteria from the International Maritime Organization (IMO) Casualties and Incidents reports. The risk factors are determined based on extensive literature review and data analysis. Then, a random oversampling (RO) method is used to process the unbalanced samples before using them as an input in the RF, where they are divided into a training set for rule learning and a test set for verifying the model's validity. Finally, the risk is calculated based on the severity probabilities returned by the RF-RO, and the severity is quantified by expert scoring. The results reveal that the proposed RF-RO performs with the greatest accuracy among similar algorithms. The feature importance measurement indicates that time and ship type are the most influential risk factors in anticipating an NTS. These findings provide a reference for stakeholders in implementing security management.","https://www.proquest.com/docview/2675574075?accountid=44943&bdid=84593&_bd=vZ0EbpjhTvIQamvUmocPfF2u%2BoA%3D","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ocecoaman.2022.106202"

However, few attempts have been made to investigate the difference in conditions between high and low tides and predict the responses in coastal waters related to nutrients and physicochemical properties. This study covered an area of 18 km from north Tanjung Gemuk to south Tanjung Tuan in Port Dickson, facing the Strait of Malacca, one of the busiest shipping routes in the world. This research investigated the relation between tides, nutrients, and physicochemical properties of water in order to provide the basis to describe the effects of tides in the coastal waters of Port Dickson, a central attraction of the Strait of Malacca. Relatively all of the studied parameters (physicochemical properties and nutrients concentration) showed higher values at low tide than at high tide, except for salinity and electrical conductivity. Relationships between nutrients and physicochemical properties at high and low tides were studied using Spearman correlation analysis. It may be noted that the relationship between nutrients and physicochemical properties at high and low tides varies from weak (r = 0.400) to moderate (r = 0.558). The multivariate statistical technique principal components analysis (PCA) was employed to better interpret information about the interaction between nutrients and physicochemical properties at high and low tides. The current study determined that there is an anthropogenic impact at increased levels of nutrient concentration, primarily for ammonia and phosphate. This study has provided new updated baseline data for the coastal waters of Port Dickson related physicochemical properties and nutrient concentration. The new updated baseline data will be used to identify and prioritize future studies and regulatory plans in Port Dickson as well as the Strait of Malacca.

A shortage of skilled labour was previously experienced by the shipping industry during the 960s. Then the problem was overcome by the widespread introduction of automation allowing substantial reductions in manning to be made. In the following decades, ships continued to be automated at an increasing rate with the introduction of periodically unattended machinery spaces and integrated bridge control systems which facilitated 'one man on watch' operations so that today, in some ships, there are crews numbering as few as six. The manpower shortage identified in the future is unlikely to be overcome by a further slimming of existing crews because it is recognised that the strain placed on the remaining crew will compromise effectiveness and safety. A new concept in ship design and operation is therefore required if the predicted manpower shortages are to be overcome and further cost reductions achieved. Unmanned ships have been proposed as a possible solution overcoming the manpower problem, and in this paper the results of a technical and economic appraisal of a fully automated unmanned cargo ship are presented within the context of expected world developments in the next decades.","https://www.proquest.com/docview/27889592?accountid=44943&bdid=84593&_bd=MiVMTC6OUZXcix4YjaKOe3DlZS0%3D",""

Unlike previous works using full SLAR images, in this work only a few scanlines from the beam-scanning of radar are needed to perform the detection. The main objective is to develop a method that performs accurate segmentation using only the current and previous sensor information, in order to return a real-time response during the flight. The proposed architecture uses a series of CMSAE networks to process in parallel each of the objectives defined as different classes. The output of these networks are given to a machine learning classifier to perform the final detection.

Here, we present evidence from an atmospheric general circulation model (AGCM) forced by the history of observed sea surface temperature (SST) that the Walker Circulation may have intensified rather than weakened. Observed Equatorial Indo-Pacific Sector SST since 1870 exhibited a zonally asymmetric evolution: While the eastern part of the Equatorial Pacific showed only a weak warming, or even cooling in one SST dataset, the western part and the Equatorial Indian Ocean exhibited a rather strong warming. This has resulted in an increase of the SST gradient between the Maritime Continent and the eastern part of the Equatorial Pacific, one driving force of the Walker Circulation. The ensemble experiments with the AGCM, with and without time-varying external forcing, suggest that the enhancement of the SST gradient drove an anomalous atmospheric circulation, with an enhancement of both Walker and Hadley Circulation. Anomalously strong precipitation is simulated over the Indian Ocean and anomalously weak precipitation over the western Pacific, with corresponding changes in the surface wind pattern. Some sensitivity to the forcing SST, however, is noticed. The analysis of twentieth century integrations with global climate models driven with observed radiative forcing obtained from the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP) database support the link between the SST gradient and Walker Circulation strength. Furthermore, control integrations with the CMIP models indicate the existence of strong internal variability on centennial timescales. The results suggest that a radiatively forced signal in the Walker Circulation during the twentieth century may have been too weak to be detectable.","https://www.proquest.com/docview/1705465210?accountid=44943&bdid=84593&_bd=D%2BgdS7EERNRWDbW9rvxJPU9XDtw%3D","https://doi.org/10.1007/s00382-011-1047-8"

There is growing interest within jurisdictions to strengthen biofouling risk-management regulations, but it is expensive to conduct in-water inspections and assess the collected data to determine the biofouling state of vessel hulls.

It is of particular concern to the international shipping industry because it increases fuel costs and presents a biosecurity risk by providing a pathway for non-indigenous marine species to establish in new areas. There is growing interest within jurisdictions to strengthen biofouling risk-management regulations, but it is expensive to conduct in-water inspections and assess the collected data to determine the biofouling state of vessel hulls.

This solution allows for early collision detection when two or more ships are on a collision course. In the newer version of AIS, a satellite infrastructure is used to extend the communication range. Unfortunately, satellite AIS deals with so-called packet collision effect: since there is a problem with synchronizing AIS data coming from multiple terrestrial areas, a single satellite may receive several AIS messages at the same time and be unable to correctly process them, causing the data to get lost or garbled. In this article, a machine learning based framework for detecting the incorrect AIS data is presented. In this approach, after the first stage (clustering), a dedicated anomaly detection algorithm searches for damaged AIS messages and conducts multi-label classification (with Random Forest and wavelet transform) to decide which fields of such message requires further correction.

At present, commonly used ZTD forecasting models comprise empirical, meteorological parameter, and neural network models. The empirical model can only fit approximate periodic variations, and its accuracy is relatively low. The accuracy of the meteorological parameter model depends heavily on the accuracy of the meteorological parameters. The recurrent neural network (RNN) is suitable for short-term series data prediction, but for long-term series, the ZTD prediction accuracy is clearly reduced. Long short-term memory (LSTM) has superior forecasting accuracy for long-term ZTD series; however, the LSTM model is complex, cannot be parallelized, and is time-consuming. In this study, we propose a novel ZTD time-series forecasting utilizing transformer-based machine-learning methods that are popular in natural language processing (NLP) and forecasting global ZTD, the training parameters provided by the global geodetic observing system (GGOS). The proposed transformer model leverages self-attention mechanisms by encoder and decoder modules to learn complex patterns and dynamics from long ZTD time series. The numeric results showed that the root mean square error (RMSE) of the forecasting ZTD results were 1.8 cm and mean bias, STD, MAE, and R 0.0, 1.7, 1.3, and 0.95, respectively, which is superior to that of the LSTM, RNN, convolutional neural network (CNN), and GPT3 series models. We investigated the global distribution of these accuracy indicators, and the results demonstrated that the accuracy in continents was superior to maritime space transformer ZTD forecasting model accuracy at high latitudes superior to that at low latitude. In addition to the overall accuracy improvement, the proposed transformer ZTD forecast model also mitigates the accuracy variations in space and time, thereby guaranteeing high accuracy globally. This study provides a novel method to estimate the ZTD, which could potentially contribute to precise GNSS positioning and meteorology.","https://www.proquest.com/docview/2718284245?accountid=44943&bdid=84593&_bd=LoBrnsoFgKLelRunowicw%2BQ%2Bhqs%3D","https://doi.org/10.3390/rs14143335"

Overhead cranes are widely used in various areas of industry, including manufacturing, construction, shipping, etc. Load transfer operations using overhead cranes have to be performed fast and safely. As such, these operations are handled by expert operators however, the demand for an automatic consistent and reliable crane operation is on the rise. The crane-load system is highly nonlinear and time-varying, hence, solutions considering model-base approaches may lead to a complicated controller structure. Such a controller may require accurate estimation of the crane system parameters. In this paper we present a new fuzzy logic controller for overhead crane operation. The fuzzy controller is designed based on knowledge of an expert crane operator, and does not require any parameter estimation. It mimics the operator behavior by using the same crane-load system states that are realized by the operator. These states are the trolley position error and the load sway angle. The fuzzy controller action, on the other hand, is the desired trolley speed. The proposed controller is implemented and tested on a small-scale overhead crane. Experimental results show robust operation of the fuzzy controller as compared with that of a conventional controller.","https://www.proquest.com/docview/221013770?accountid=44943&bdid=84593&_bd=JL3PlG9mBfKKDALfsbsCQD1vTY8%3D",""

Here a new algorithm was designed for Creating Aerosol Types from CHemistry (CATCH). CATCH-derived aerosol types--dusty mix, maritime, urban, smoke, and fresh smoke--are based on first-generation airborne High Spectral Resolution Lidar (HSRL-1) retrievals during the Ship-Aircraft Bio-Optical Research (SABOR) campaign, July/August 2014. CATCH is designed to derive aerosol types from model output of chemical composition. CATCH-derived aerosol types are determined by multivariate clustering of model-calculated variables that have been trained using retrievals of aerosol types from HSRL-1. CATCH-derived aerosol types (with the exception of smoke) compare well with HSRL-1 retrievals during SABOR with an average difference in aerosol optical depth (AOD) <0.03. Data analysis shows that episodic free tropospheric transport of smoke is underpredicted by the Goddard Earth Observing System- with Chemistry (GEOS-Chem) model. Spatial distributions of CATCH-derived aerosol types for the North American model domain during July/August 2014 show that aerosol type-specific AOD values occurred over representative locations: urban over areas with large population, maritime over oceans, smoke, and fresh smoke over typical biomass burning regions. This study demonstrates that model-generated information on aerosol chemical composition can be translated into aerosol types analogous to those retrieved from remote sensing methods. In the future, spaceborne HSRL-1 and CATCH can be used to gain insight into chemical composition of aerosol types, reducing uncertainties in estimates of aerosol radiative forcing.Key PointsThe developed CATCH algorithm is capable of connecting chemical transport models to remote sensing by producing model-derived aerosol typesAerosols in North American pollution outflow over the Atlantic mainly consist of urban and smoke types, transported below 3 km heightSpaceborne HSRL-1 and CATCH can be used to gain insight into the chemical composition of aerosol types over different regions","https://www.proquest.com/docview/1976752206?accountid=44943&bdid=84593&_bd=utwiRBwCUpLJYu5FLItXb75%2F%2BXg%3D","https://doi.org/10.1002/2017JD026913"

Activities connected with shipping and handling of goods in ports may harm both human health and the environment. These activities include different (mostly diesel-fueled) machinery used in ports, resulting in air emissions including GHG, NOX, SOX, PM, etc. Besides air pollution, port activities affect noise, light, and odor emission, waste accumulation and water pollution. Existing methodologies for estimating environmental impacts of port activities are mostly qualitative and include self-assessment methods which can often lead to biased results. Because of that, there is a need for a quantitative, industry-validated, and cohesive method that would give more accurate results. In this article, the Port Environmental Index (PEI) which has all the attributes described above will be presented. The PEI mission is to integrate all of the main environmental aspects of port such as air emission, waste production, water pollution, noise, light, and odor pollution into one metric that can then be used to assess the port performance and make comparison between ports. The PEI is made as a quantitative composite index based on aggregations of individual indicators for significant aspects of port operations. It includes different indices according to the source of the emission; the Ship Environmental Index (SEI), the Terminal Environmental Index (TEI), and the Port Authority Environmental Index (PAEI). While designing the PEI, correctly choosing the environmental impacts is paramount to properly identify port activities and associated environmental aspects. After their identification, for each significant aspect, a set of representative environmental key performance indicators (eKPIs) is identified. Afterwards, a series of mathematical operations are to be applied: normalization, weighting and aggregation. In this short communication, those methods are outlined yet not definitively chosen. The main idea behind the PEI is to use quantitative, data-based information collected automatically leveraging Internet of Things (IoT) techniques making it possible to assess the environmental impacts of port operations in real-time. The advantages of having such metric in the environmental management plan of a port are numerous. Amongst the most remarkable, it allows inter-port comparison and it can be used for decision making to estimate the impacts using one single metric rather than having many disperse values. Moreover, it can be used by ports for estimating their environmental performance and progress. Since it is based on information collected using IoT technologies provided in real-time, ports can make immediate corrections in their activities.","https://www.proquest.com/docview/2524281802?accountid=44943&bdid=84593&_bd=Pm9bWtYY1Z5rKiF1yBM5i3g07S0%3D","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ecolind.2020.106949"

In a departure from other work on data-driven optimization, we consider data consisting, not only of observations of quantities with direct effect on costs/revenues, such as demand or returns, but also predominantly of observations of associated auxiliary quantities. The main problem of interest is a conditional stochastic optimization problem, given imperfect observations, where the joint probability distributions that specify the problem are unknown. We demonstrate how our proposed methods are generally applicable to a wide range of decision problems and prove that they are computationally tractable and asymptotically optimal under mild conditions, even when data are not independent and identically distributed and for censored observations. We extend these to the case in which some decision variables, such as price, may affect uncertainty and their causal effects are unknown. We develop the coefficient of prescriptiveness P to measure the prescriptive content of data and the efficacy of a policy from an operations perspective.

However, traditional multibeam or light detection and ranging (LiDAR) survey techniques used to produce high-quality bathymetric maps are expensive. Satellite-derived bathymetry provides a fast and inexpensive method for the large-scale mapping of shallow-water areas and can overcome the complexities of traditional bathymetric mapping methods in these areas. Traditionally, linear regression models, most commonly the Stumpf model, are used for satellite-based bathymetric modeling. However, nonlinear artificial neural network (ANN) models have been recently developed and implemented for satellite-based bathymetric modeling and are under significant investigation to develop the most accurate and optimal model. This article proposes two new hybrid ANN-based models for bathymetric modeling and investigates their performance using satellite imagery data and “truth” depth data for a coastal shallow-water study area. Two-hybrid ANN algorithms are developed, namely, particle swarm optimization (PSO)-ANN and optimally pruned extreme learning machine (OPELM), and their results are compared with the traditional Stumpf method and current state-of-the-art ANN model. The study area dataset comprises the “truth” depth data from a nautical chart of the Alqumriyah Island study area in Saudi Arabia and the corresponding spectral reflection values of green, blue, and near-infrared bands from the free-of-charge Level-1C product of Sentinel-2A images used to train and validate the two newly developed models and the traditional models. The results show that the developed OPELM method can accurately derive the bathymetry and is superior to the developed PSO-ANN model, the current state-of-the-art ANN model, and the traditional Stumpf model by 12.10%, 18.76%, and 32.46%, respectively. The OPELM model can also be used for bathymetric modeling of shallow-water areas with depths up to 30 m with a high level of accuracy compared with the current state-of-the-art ANN and traditional methods. The significant contribution of this research is that it is the first investigation of the artificial intelligence-based hybrid OPELM method for accurate bathymetric modeling and will certainly encourage further investigations of hybrid models. Moreover, this research explores whether these developed hybrid models can meet the International Hydrographic Organization standards for hydrographic survey applications.","https://www.proquest.com/docview/2622826432?accountid=44943&bdid=84593&_bd=zPkRluVIARZb%2F3j%2BvAG5of3ZuaM%3D","https://doi.org/10.1109/TGRS.2021.3107839"

However, its current energy management system, with relatively simple control scheme and low-level automation, can hardly operate the system in a secure and economic manner to match the rapid progress of offshore oil and gas exploitation. To address this issue, an online multi-objective optimal power control strategy is proposed and implemented based on the existing SCADA system. By incorporating network loss, gas consumption and voltage deviation into a synthesized objective function and taking the various operational constraints into account, the power-control task is formulated into a mixed-integer nonlinear optimized problem. And then an efficient procedure that combines the interior point method and the fast branch and bound method is developed to solve the problem. Consequently the optimal control strategy can be obtained online and either system security or operational efficiency is achieved. The developed control system has been put into practical use in the Weixinan offshore oil-platform power system (China’s first of its kind). Field test results show that it can coordinate active and reactive power for online optimal control as per the changes of operating conditions. The improved safety, efficiency and power quality of the power system will definitely promote exploitation of offshore oil and gas in the respect of both security and efficiency.","https://www.proquest.com/docview/2134377930?accountid=44943&bdid=84593&_bd=l%2BTS%2FYXV%2Bo7tktiNvwQ%2BHzkUans%3D","https://doi.org/10.1007/s40866-018-0056-7"

Until recently, only about 2% of ships entering U.S. ports have had their cargoes inspected. The percentage at some ports has now risen to 6%, but this is still a very small percentage. The purpose of this project was to develop decision support algorithms that help to optimally intercept illicit materials and weapons. The algorithms developed focused on finding inspection schemes that minimize total cost, including the 'cost' of false positives and false negatives. The project viewed the inspection problem as a stream of entities arriving at a port, with a decision maker having to decide how to inspect them, which to subject to further inspection, and which to allow to pass through with only minimal levels of inspection. This is a complex sequential decision making problem. Sequential decision making is an old subject, but one that has become increasingly important with the need for new models and algorithms as the traditional methods for making decisions sequentially do not scale. Previous algorithms for optimally intercepting illicit cargo assumed that sensor performance, operating characteristics of ports, and overall threat level were all fixed. The author's approach involved decision logics and was built around problem formulations that led to the need for combinatorial optimization algorithms as well as methods from the theory of Boolean functions, queueing theory, and machine learning. Algorithms for designing port-of-entry inspection rapidly come up against the combinatorial explosion caused by the many possible alternative inspection strategies. In this project, the authors worked to develop an approach that brings many of these complications explicitly into the analysis.","https://www.proquest.com/docview/23954520?accountid=44943&bdid=84593&_bd=jHtVL2sbG3Nv1Mkql4BVP2pYP1c%3D",""

However, big data size increases the cost of storing, querying, and processing AIS data in practical applications. AIS data includes not only the ship spatial position information but also the course, speed, heading information et al . In other words, the knowledge of ship handling behavior is hidden in AIS data. In fact, many practical applications, such as maritime accident investigation and evidence collection, route extraction, ship behavior analysis, will require a compression algorithm to retain the ship key handling points in the original trajectory. To address these research challenges, the ship trajectory compression algorithm considering handling patterns is proposed in this paper. In order to explain the implicit handling patterns of AIS trajectories, the suggested method adopts the rate of course change (ROCC) and the rate of speed change (ROSC) in the sliding window as the criterion of whether the current trajectory point can be simplified. Numerical experiments are performed to verify the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.

In the clinical setting, data collected from two electrodes are used to guide the hand movements selecting among a finite number of postures. Machine learning has been applied in the past to the sEMG signal (not in the clinical setting) with interesting results, which provide more insight on how these data could be used to improve prosthetic functionality. Researchers have mainly concentrated so far on increasing the accuracy of sEMG classification and/or regression, but, in general, a finer control implies a longer training period. A desirable characteristic would be to shorten the time needed by a patient to learn how to use the prosthesis. To this aim, we propose here a general method to reuse past experience, in the form of models synthesized from previous subjects, to boost the adaptivity of the prosthesis. Extensive tests on databases recorded from healthy subjects in controlled and noncontrolled conditions reveal that the method significantly improves the results over the baseline nonadaptive case. This promising approach might be employed to pretrain a prosthesis before shipping it to a patient, leading to a shorter training phase.

An autonomous decision-making capability in the terminal is vital in achieving the required productivity. Vessel scheduling/berthing system in a container terminal is regarded as a very complex dynamic application in today's business world. The Artificial Intelligence (Al) community has been researching in the field of intelligent (or rational) agents for more than a decade and implementations are found in many commercial applications. The Beliefs, Desires and Intention (BDI) agent architecture is probably the most mature model for many industrial applications in today's context. However, it is not the best agent model for complex applications that must learn and adapt their behaviours in making rational decisions. We propose a new hybrid BDI framework with an intelligent module to overcome the limitations in the generic BDI model. Learning and the adaptability of the environments are assured with the introduction of the Knowledge Acquisition Module (KAM) in the generic BDI architecture in our proposed framework. The dynamic selection of the intention structures has been improved with a trained neural network. The knowledge required to handle vagueness or uncertainty in the environment has been modelled with an Adaptive Neuro Fuzzy Inference System (ANFIS) in berths. Finally, the benefits and the usability of hybrid BDI model for a vessel berthing application is discussed with experiential results.

A machine vision system with a monochrome camera was used to identify eight western Canadian wheat classes at four moisture levels (11%, 14%, 17% and 20% wet basis) by bulk sample analysis (n=100 images for each group of samples). Grayscale images (1024x768 pixels) of the grain bulk were captured by the monochrome camera, and stored on a data acquisition system. Algorithms were developed to extract 32 textural features automatically from the grayscale images. The mean gray values of the western Canadian wheat classes ranged between 106 and 143, and it was the highest for Canada Prairie Spring Red and the lowest for Canada Western Extra Strong and Canada Western Red Winter. The mean gray values of the wheat samples were significantly higher at 17% moisture content and lower at 11% moisture content among the tested moisture levels (=0.05). The overall classification accuracies of a quadratic discriminant function were 93.8%, 92.5%, 92.0% and 94.4% when the wheat classes were at 11%, 14%, 17% and 20% moisture contents, respectively. Similarly, the accuracies of a linear discriminant function were 96.1%, 95.0%, 95.4% and 96.3% at 11%, 14%, 17% and 20% moisture contents, respectively. When the wheat classes were identified irrespective of moisture levels (images of the four moisture level grains in each class were mixed together), the accuracy was 89.8% and 85.4% for quadratic and linear discriminant functions, respectively. A monochrome image analysis system has the potential to use for online identification of classes in wheat handling facilities. However, further research is required to determine the performance of the developed method for impurities in bulk grain such as foreign material and dockage.","https://www.proquest.com/docview/46252353?accountid=44943&bdid=84593&_bd=sEPGJst3lpAw%2FTHV%2FGpcMh8qLVQ%3D","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jcs.2007.06.008"

The data collection methods comprised overseas trips to carry out unstructured field observation and interviews, a nine-item structured questionnaire, and unobtrusive measures from Government statistical publications in four different countries. In the data-analysis process, the questionnaire data were used to rank the importance of services required by major shipping lines in order to formulate the appropriate marketing strategy. The Government statistics data were used to test a hypothesis that Manila is more cost-effective as a transshipment centre compared with three other major Asian ports. Testing of the hypothesis was based on the theory of General Equilibrium. A response rate of 60 per cent was obtained from the 30 mailed questionnaires. Finds that the most important services required by the major shipping lines were: (1) berth availability, (2) efficient operation, (3) cost. On the transshipment economics analysis, the alternative hypothesis: It is more cost-effective to use Manila as a transshipment centre compared with Hong Kong, Kaohsiung and Singapore, was found to be sustained. Notes, however, that, although Manila is found to be the most cost-effective on the whole system, Singapore is the cheapest, when considering stevedoring cost only, while Hong Kong is the cheapest when considering port charges and vessel-steaming cost. On the whole, the existing marketing strategy of MICT, as observed during the various trips, was found to be sound and well-justified.

In this regard, because batteries are the main power source in underwater environments, there is a clear need to minimize the consumption of energy. In addition, underwater links that make use of acoustic soundwaves can cause relatively long propagation delays. In our proposed scheme, we focus on the initial connection procedure between sensor nodes and underwater base stations to tackle these environmental problems, in which the former estimates the signal strength of the latter. From local information measured during the initial network entry phase, underwater sensor nodes determine locational priority of candidate targets, but do not scan or measure the signal strength of other neighbouring underwater base stations as a means of keeping the power consumption to an absolute minimum. This can be considered an appropriate scenario for use in severely battery-limited environments such as IoUT. Based on analysis using machine learning, we obtain meaningful clues regarding the procedure for handover prediction without channel measurement. By removing the overhead from the channel measurement, the power consumption of the underwater things can be minimized. Two different methods of deciding on handover priority are suggested and analysed mathematically. The performance of each method is evaluated through intensive system-level simulations and compared to that of a more conventional scheme.","https://www.proquest.com/docview/2453818786?accountid=44943&bdid=84593&_bd=fqoCobtNFM3KLhtGIiv6o1ne%2FA8%3D","https://doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2020.3029602"

The good fault‐tolerant capacity and robustness of the fault‐tolerant permanent magnet motor (FTPMM) make it a potentially highly effective and economical propulsion motor in the electric power propulsion ship than other alternatives. In this paper, the structure and mathematical model of FTPMM are analyzed and the improved sliding mode observer (SMO) is constructed according to the deviation between the observed currents and actual currents. Combined with model reference adaptive control (MRAC) method and the phase‐lock loop (PLL), the switch function is replaced by the continuous Sigmoid function to reduce the chattering and finally the rotor position estimated accuracy is improved. When the motor winding open‐circuit and short‐circuit fault occur, the current vector fault‐tolerant control strategy is introduced into the improved SMO algorithm, and the rotor position is estimated accurately under faulty conditions. Finally, the proposed improved SMO position estimation algorithm under healthy and faulty conditions is verified in Matlab/Simulink.

Literature data on behaviour of this pathogen on fresh-cut lettuce and spinach was taken from published graphs by digitization, published tables or from personal communications. A three-phase growth function was fitted to the data from 13 studies, and a square root model for growth rate ( mu ) as a function of temperature was derived: mu = (0.023*(Temperature-1.20)) super(2). Variability in the published data was incorporated into the growth model by the use of weighted regression and the 95% prediction limits. A log-linear die-off function was fitted to the data from 13 studies, and the resulting rate constants were fitted to a shifted lognormal distribution (Mean: 0.013; Standard Deviation, 0.010; Shift, 0.001).

Law enforcement and/or public safety and health officials often have the responsibility for identifying the human remains found at the scene, so they can be returned to their families. The recovered human remains range from being relatively intact to highly degraded. DNA-based identity testing is a powerful tool for victim identification in that the data are not restricted to any particular one to one body landmark comparison and DNA profile comparisons can be used to associate separated remains or body parts. Even though DNA typing is straightforward, a disaster is a chaotic environment that can complicate effective identification of the remains. With some planning, or at least identification of the salient features to consider, stress can be reduced for those involved in the identification process. General guidelines are provided for developing an action plan for identification of human remains from a mass disaster by DNA analysis. These include: (1) sample collection, preservation, shipping and storage; (2) tracking and chain of custody issues; (3) laboratory facilities; (4) quality assurance and quality control practices; (5) parsing out work; (6) extraction and typing; (7) interpretation of results; (8) automation; (9) software for tracking and managing data; (10) the use of an advisory panel; (11) education and communication; and (12) privacy issues. In addition, key technologies that may facilitate the identification process are discussed, such as resin based DNA extraction, real-time PCR for quantitation of DNA, use of mini-STRs, SNP detection procedures, and software. Many of the features necessary for DNA typing of human remains from a mass disaster are the same as those for missing persons' cases. Therefore, developing a missing persons DNA identification program would also provide the basis for a mass disaster human remains DNA identification program.","https://www.proquest.com/docview/21138318?accountid=44943&bdid=84593&_bd=Bx%2F2xSLasSzqYTD8USk23sDpUt4%3D","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.legalmed.2005.01.001"

Damage control also is critical to the survival of a warship and the safety of the crew. Consequently, it is very important to ship operators. It is no surprise, therefore, that damage control is a key function of concern when designing new ships to operate with fewer people.

Tests were conducted in which VGGNet and ResNet networks were applied to classify the input data. The data was preprocessed using either Constant Q Transform (CQT), Gammatone, Mel spectrogram, or a combination of these filters.

Great consideration is now given to the protection of the marine environment and the atmosphere from the ever-increasing carbon emissions, which has resulted in the rediscovery of wind-powered navigation. It is worth noting that the global demand for and purchases of medium and large sailing boats and motor yachts with sails have plummeted over the last 10-15 years. The effect of wind and seas on sailing ships operation is disproportionately greater compared to motor-driven vessels. For the purposes of safe navigation sailing crews must closely observe the parameters of sailing vessels' movement, hydro-meteorological conditions and navigational aids' operation. They provide essential information of the ship's position, course, heel angle and rudder angle, distance made good, the elements of the hydro-meteorological conditions as well as forthcoming weather forecast, etc. Present-day sailing relies on these parameters for the normal operation of the various automatic systems used in the handling of sailing vessels.

However, they do not fully handle highly nonlinear and complex ship dynamics in the docking operation beyond our explicit understanding. On the contrary, data-driven models deal with such non-linearity and complexity in a non-parametric manner, however, the maritime industry does not regard them as reliable and applicable models due to the lack of interpretability and the physics foundation. To alleviate this dilemma, this study proposes a physics-data co-operative ship dynamic model for the docking operation; a knowledge-based ship model serves as a physics foundation with supportive data-driven models compensating a single-step-ahead velocity prediction error made by a physics foundation model. Neural networks trained with onboard sensor data are employed in supportive data-driven models. In a case study, we conducted full-scale docking operations of a 28.9m-length research vessel Gunnerus. The results show that mean prediction error in a position at 30s future is reduced by 34.6% compared to that made solely by a physics foundation model. The present approach will be the first step in the development of high-fidelity and cost-efficient ship dynamic models, thus contributing to ship autonomy in the future.","https://www.proquest.com/docview/2672088769?accountid=44943&bdid=84593&_bd=lDfGvwPTp0yfdOUlM57xVRpUqhA%3D","https://doi.org/10.1109/JSEN.2022.3171036"

Overhead cranes are widely used in various areas of industry, including manufacturing, construction, shipping, etc. Load transfer operations using overhead cranes have to be performed fast and safely. As such, these operations are handled by expert operators; however, the demand for an automatic consistent and reliable crane operation is on the rise. The crane-load system is highly nonlinear and time-varying, hence, solutions considering model-base approaches may lead to a complicated controller structure. Such a controller may require accurate estimation of the crane system parameters. In this paper we present a new fuzzy logic controller for overhead crane operation. The fuzzy controller is designed based on knowledge of an expert crane operator, and does not require any parameter estimation. It mimics the operator behavior by using the same crane-load system states that are realized by the operator. These states are the trolley position error and the load sway angle. The fuzzy controller action, on the other hand, is the desired trolley speed. The proposed controller is implemented and tested on a small-scale overhead crane. Experimental results show robust operation of the fuzzy controller as compared with that of a conventional controller.","https://www.proquest.com/docview/28449840?accountid=44943&bdid=84593&_bd=0x4d%2B8pk9%2BLK0lx0vakwmqTIO04%3D","https://doi.org/10.1177/1077546304042038"

These conventional analyses of coal are an indispensable method over the years and have tested by high skilled petrologists. Though, these types of optical or machine-dependent recognition of coal category samples are quite slow, expensive, and restricted by subjective analyses with less accuracy. The main aim of this research is to propose an accurate, time, and cost-effective machine learning-based automated characterization system by analyzing coal color and textural features.

Psychological issues such as depression, anxiety, suicide, and alcohol or drug dependence are recognized health problems within the maritime sector. The primary aim of this study was to identify which individual and occupational factors, known to impact on psychological functioning across the maritime industry and other sectors, best predict perceived stress and job satisfaction among a sample of merchant seafarers. Methods: Secondary data analysis was conducted using a work experiences and attitudes questionnaire administered by a large shipping company to seafarers within their organization. Structural equation modeling was conducted using a proposed theoretical model of perceived stress and job satisfaction in a sample of merchant seafarers. Results: While the structural equation model produced acceptable fit to the sample data according to numerous goodness-of-fit statistics, the comparative fit index and Tucker-Lewis index results indicated less than satisfactory model fit. The model explained 23.8% of variance in the criterion variable of perceived stress, and the strongest predictive effect was for dispositional resilience. The model explained 70.6% of variance in the criterion variable of job satisfaction, and the strongest predictive effect was for instrumental work support. Conclusion: When addressing the psychosocial well-being of merchant seafarers, findings of this study suggest that dispositional resilience may be a particularly important factor with regards to perceived stress, while instrumental work support appears to be a critical factor in relation to job satisfaction. Importantly, however, an overall work environment that is perceived by employees as supportive, equal and just is a cornerstone for the psychosocial well-being of seafarers.","https://www.proquest.com/docview/2184534499?accountid=44943&bdid=84593&_bd=6e6jmMJmrP8Q6b133w6oqW3lfpA%3D","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2019.00070"

The specifications of the non-selected choice are imputed in a machine learning module. Shipping cost is found to be a central factor for rail shipments, while road shipments are found to be more sensitive to haul time. Sensitivity of mode choice decisions is further analyzed under different fuel price fluctuation scenarios. A low level of mode choice sensitivity is found with respect to fuel price, such that even a 50% increase in fuel cost does not cause a significant modal shift between truck and rail.

In US waters, snow crabs are found throughout the Arctic and sub-Arctic seas surrounding Alaska, north of the Aleutian Islands, yet commercial harvest currently focuses on the more southerly population in the Bering Sea. Population dynamics are well-monitored in exploited areas, but few data exist for populations further north where climate trends in the Arctic appear to be affecting species' distributions and community structure on multiple trophic levels. Moreover, increased shipping traffic, as well as fisheries and petroleum resource development, may add additional pressures in northern portions of the range as seasonal ice cover continues to decline. In the face of these pressures, we examined the ecological niche and population distribution of snow crabs in Alaskan waters using a GIS-based spatial modeling approach. We present the first quantitative open-access model predictions of snow-crab distribution, abundance, and biomass in the Chukchi and Beaufort Seas. Multi-variate analysis of environmental drivers of species' distribution and community structure commonly rely on multiple linear regression methods. The spatial modeling approach employed here improves upon linear regression methods in allowing for exploration of nonlinear relationships and interactions between variables. Three machine-learning algorithms were used to evaluate relationships between snow-crab distribution and environmental parameters, including TreeNet, Random Forests, and MARS. An ensemble model was then generated by combining output from these three models to generate consensus predictions for presence-absence, abundance, and biomass of snow crabs. Each algorithm identified a suite of variables most important in predicting snow-crab distribution, including nutrient and chlorophyll-a concentrations in overlying waters, temperature, salinity, and annual sea-ice cover; this information may be used to develop and test hypotheses regarding the ecology of this species. This is the first such quantitative model for snow crabs, and all GIS-data layers compiled for this project are freely available from the authors, upon request, for public use and improvement.","https://www.proquest.com/docview/918061497?accountid=44943&bdid=84593&_bd=mvxPq6mLci2V8ZvjpyJwVJaYEzI%3D","https://doi.org/10.1093/icb/icr102"

Hydrodynamic and residence time (RT) simulations were set up for three different bathymetric configurations of the lower lagoon, representative of distinct situations. Hydrodynamic results confirmed that tidal propagation depends strongly on the bathymetric configuration. At the transitions between channels, tidal energy losses occur and flood dominance increases. Dredging the channels and repositioning the inlet throat improve tidal propagation and promote sediment flushing to the sea. The spatial variability of RTs was evaluated through the integration of individual particle results in morphologically relevant units, while time variability was examined within the tidal and neap/spring cycles. Residence times depend heavily on the morphological changes associated with both dredging operations and inlet migration, and on the particle release time, both within the tidal cycle and within neap/spring cycles. The relative importance of each of these factors depends on the particle location within the lagoon. The upstream regions of the lagoon have very large RTs (years), as a result of the small tidal amplitudes and velocities. In some of these regions, RTs vary by a factor of 4 depending on the bathymetry of the inlet. In the lower lagoon, tidal amplitude also has a significant effect on RTs. Dredging the channels and repositioning the inlet throat from the southern margin to a central position improves the flushing of both southern and northern channels.","https://www.proquest.com/docview/20984910?accountid=44943&bdid=84593&_bd=Nod2542QSEl8iIVne8XUa%2FQLid8%3D","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.csr.2006.02.011"

Shipping, fishing, recreational boating, and offshore exploration in these data-sparse areas represent a wealth of information. To take advantage of these potential observers, the NWS, in cooperation with the Marine Advisory Service of the NOAA Sea Grant Office, has launched a Mariner Report (MAREP) program. Patterned after aviation Pilot Reports (PIREPs), the MAREP concept seeks to recruit private coastal marine radio stations and mariners on a volunteer basis to relay weather and sea state observations to NWS forecast offices. These data are combined with other information to issue and update marine warnings and forecasts. Where possible, products are relayed back to the radio stations for broadcast to mariners as a payback for their participation. As of Oct. 1984, there are 30 MAREP locations around the country supplying an average, per site, of 6-30 reports daily to NWS. Automation techniques to minimize manual workload are being tested at sites on the east and Gulf coasts. Results from these tests and experience gained from the present network will form the basis of a national MAREP program. A nationwide MAREP network of similar to 100 radio collection sites is planned to provide expanded data coverage within the 200-mi Exclusive Economic Zone and the Great Lakes.","https://www.proquest.com/docview/18320668?accountid=44943&bdid=84593&_bd=Eqjufm1ok9K%2FU2e3GTkF8z7l9cc%3D",""

We propose a cost-efficient recycled FPGA detection method using a statistical performance characterization technique called virtual probe (VP) based on compressed sensing. The VP technique enables the accurate prediction of the spatial process variation of RO frequencies on a die by using a very small number of sample RO measurements. Using the predicted frequency variation as a supervisor, the machine-learning model classifies target FPGAs as either recycled or fresh. Through experiments conducted using 50 commercial FPGAs, we demonstrate that the proposed method achieves 90% cost reduction for RO measurements while preserving the detection accuracy.

It provides trajectory information of vessels which can be used for the classification task. The classification results facilitate ocean surveillance and conservation, vessel management enhancement, fishery regulation, marine ecological sustainability, and nautical safety protection. Some progresses have been made based on machine learning or deep learning strategies to perform supervised learning by assuming that during the training process, the category labels of historical trajectory data are available. However, in reality, the label information may be difficult or expensive to obtain, resulting in that only a small part of the training data is labeled, and most of the training data is unlabeled. To address this issue, this paper proposes a semi-supervised deep learning approach to integrate the knowledge of unlabeled data for vessel trajectory classification. Here, we call our approach SSL-VTC. Specifically, we first extract vessel trajectories by integrating the kinematic and static information from historical AIS messages. Then, we design convolutional neural networks to extract feature representations from the vessel trajectories. Finally, we develop a semi-supervised learning algorithm based on the variational autoencoder to perform discriminative learning and generative learning simultaneously. In this way, our SSL-VTC framework can fully leverage the labeled data and unlabeled data during the training process. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to utilize semi-supervised learning for vessel trajectory classification. Experimental results on the public AIS dataset show that our SSL-VTC can effectively extract feature representations from the AIS messages and its performance is significantly better than the traditional supervised learning methods. The approach and findings of this study provide important implications for researchers and stakeholders in the field of ocean management.","https://www.proquest.com/docview/2636623663?accountid=44943&bdid=84593&_bd=OWLS%2BjtH461p72QvTB%2F7%2BlAaVis%3D","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ocecoaman.2021.106015"

The convective processes accompanied with the sea ice formation result bottom water formation. The cold and dense bottom water moves towards the equator along the ocean basins and takes part in the global thermohaline circulation. Sea ice edge is a potential indicator of climate change. Additionally, fishing and commercial shipping activities as well as military submarine operations in the polar seas need reliable ice edge information. However, as the sea ice edge is unstable in time, the temporal validity of the estimated ice edge is often shorter than the time required to transfer the information to the operational user. Hence, an accurate sea ice edge prediction as well as determination is crucial for fine-scale geophysical modeling and for near-real-time operations. In this study, active contour modelling (known as Snake model) and non-rigid motion estimation techniques have been used for predicting the sea ice edge (SIE) in the Antarctic. For this purpose the SIE has been detected from sea ice concentration derived using special sensor microwave imager (SSM/I) observations. The 15% sea ice concentration pixels are being taken as the edge pixel between ice and water. The external force, gradient vector flow (GVF), of SIE for total the Antarctic region is parameterised for daily as well as weekly data set.

These predicted points have been used to constitute a SIE using artificial intelligence technique, the gradient vector flow (GVF). The predicted edge has been validated with that of SSM/I.

On-demand mapping reverses this paradigm in that it is the map that adapts to the user’s needs and context of use. Still often manual and reserved for professionals, on-demand mapping is evolving toward an automation of its processes and a democratization of its use. An on-demand mapping service is a chain of several consecutive steps leading to a target map that precisely meets the needs and requirements of a user. This article addresses the issue of selecting relevant thematic layers with a specific context of use. We propose a knowledge-based recommendation approach that aims to guide a cartographer through the process of map-making. Our system is based on high- and low-level ontologies, the latter modeling the concepts specific to different types of maps targeted. By focusing on maritime maps, we address the representation of knowledge in this context of use, where recommendations rely on axiomatic and rule-based reasoning. For this purpose, we choose description logics as a formalism for knowledge representation in order to make cartographic knowledge machine readable.","https://www.proquest.com/docview/2636679213?accountid=44943&bdid=84593&_bd=thaig8VXX%2FRLHHlA3Nawy75fjMM%3D","https://doi.org/10.3390/ijgi10110786"

Container terminals are service providers to cargo owners (i.e., shippers) as well as liner shipping firms (i.e., carriers) while priorities and requirements may differ. Terminal operators should define the equilibrium quality and configuration of terminal services subject to its own constraints (e.g., financial sustainability). The mainstream approach for evaluation of service quality needs to focus on a particular customer (or group of customers) ceteris paribus. In this paper, the multi-layer quality function deployment (ML-QFD) method is applied to the terminal operators in two-customer context (shippers and carriers). ML-QFD is capable of merging diversified perspectives of several customers and delivering an equilibrium outcome which may satisfy both stakeholders in a cooperative approach. Rather than indefinite superficial recommendations, ML-QFD gets to the point and finds specific technical measures which improve the intended problem. Empirical results (East Asian sample) indicate that both shippers and carriers fundamentally demand cheaper services while shippers also require rapid terminal operations in common with the literature. For achieving requirements of shippers and carriers (in equilibrium), the role of human resource management, operational excellence and automation are emphasised by subjects.","https://www.proquest.com/docview/1808095745?accountid=44943&bdid=84593&_bd=LXV%2BA2hl3gfeVAV3pBBTRrwRQxY%3D","https://doi.org/10.1504/IJSTL.2016.075011"

The concept of the ship domain is of major importance in the assessment of a navigational situation and the avoidance of ship collisions. It is difficult to determine a ship domain as its shape and size depend on a number of factors. One question to be answered before the determination of the ship domain is which method to use: statistical, analytic, or expert method using artificial intelligence tools; other questions are connected with domain interpretation. The authors have analyzed the ship domain as a criterion for the assessment of ship navigational safety in an encounter situation in the open sea. The research results are used to answer some of the questions. Part 2 includes definitions of the ship domain and ship fuzzy domain. Part 3, in turn, presents methods of their determination as well as relevant questions. The results of the authors' research, described in Part 4, make up a basis for the determination of the domain and ship fuzzy domain. These have been determined with the so-called dynamic domains as a point of departure. The criteria of ship domain and closest point of approach are compared and discussed. Encounters of various size ships are considered in Part 5. The research and its results are described. Both ship domains and ship fuzzy domains of encountering ships are analyzed.

Replicas of individual barnacles and barnacle colonies, and living colonies were studied in a 5 m seawater flume using tracer dyes, macro video-photography and image digitization and in a small flume fitted with differential pressure sensors. Using replicas, colonization densities were manipulated to determine the dynamics of complex barnacle populations. These techniques enabled the quantification of drag, boundary layers and their interrelationships with mean flow velocity and population density. These data show that mean stream velocity affected the size and magnitude of the boundary layer and that at higher velocities the flow over the height at which the cirri were operating was decreased proportionally greater than at low mean stream velocities. The effect on flow velocity over the cirri with increased boundary layer at higher mean stream velocities was assessed and an optimum mean stream velocity for flow over cirri identified. Density of barnacles was shown to have an effect on the flow characteristics over the population, with flow changing from independent flow at low densities, through interactive flow to skimming flow at higher densities. Drag was also shown to be affected by barnacle density.

Impacts on maritime transportation were huge, as seaborne trade represents over 80% of global merchandise trade. Investigating how COVID-19 has affected ship behaviours is significant for economic condition evaluation, port management. This paper develops an analysis method to mine knowledge from raw Automation Identification System (AIS) data. First, berths are identified by improved density-based spatial clustering of applications with noise by Pythagoras distance (PD-DBSCAN). Data features, such as ship deadweight, arrival time, dwelling time, ship types, etc., can then be extracted using information matching and statistical analysis. Next, the dynamic time warping method is employed to analyse abnormal ship behaviour patterns and quantify the impacts of COVID-19. After that, a significance test is employed to determine an impact threshold through year-on-year analysis on ship flow, daily throughout and berthing time of quays. Finally, statistical analysis is used for the short-term impact analysis. This research examines a case study based on four-year AIS data in the Oslo port area. The results show that the proposed method can identify abnormal patterns caused by COVID-19 and estimate its impacts. Passenger ships are influenced heavily compared with cargo ships. The variation of passenger ships’ flow is over 90% during 2020, larger than the average variation before 2020.

Moreover, HTS will also play an important role in the up coming 5G mobile networks where HTS will provide services like disaster relief, remote automation, maritime services etc. However, the distortions caused by the on-board transponder filters and high power amplifiers (HPAs) reduce the overall performance of HTS. To increase the power and bandwidth efficiency, the transponder HPAs are often operated close to saturation and in multicarrier mode. In addition, the transponder filters are built with tighter guard bands to minimize the out-of-band (OOB) radiations. Such operation conditions introduce severe linear and non-linear distortions in the transponder’s output in terms of inter-modulation (IMD) noise, spectral regrowth, and memory effects. Digital predistortion (DPD) can effectively mitigate these distortions. This article proposes an on-board implementation of a ground-based state-of-the-art bandlimited memory polynomial (MP) DPD method to mitigate the aforementioned distortions. The authors stress on the fact that the on-board application of the proposed ground-based DPD makes it the most suitable DPD method for HTS. However, the focus of this article lies in the identification of the system parameters which effect the predistortion performance. To this end, the performance of the considered state-of-the-art DPD is thoroughly analyzed for varying uplink-signal, transponder and DPD specific parameters.","https://www.proquest.com/docview/2505710782?accountid=44943&bdid=84593&_bd=P40RdLAy5%2BFnC2YyWrnPiOyp0S8%3D","https://doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3065745"

The strong dependency on the synoptic weather conditions, rather than on city-specific, constant features, hinders the identification of recurrent patterns, leading conventional predicting algorithms to fail. In this paper, an advanced artificial intelligence technique based on long short-term memory (LSTM) model is applied to gain insight and predict the highly fluctuating heat island intensity (UHII) in the city of Sydney, Australia, governed by the dualistic system of cool sea breeze from the ocean and hot western winds from the vast desert biome inlands. Hourly measurements of temperature, collected for a period of 18 years (1999–2017) from 8 different sites in a 50 km radius from the coastline, were used to train (80%) and test (20%) the model. Other inputs included date, time, and previously computed UHII, feedbacked to the model with an optimized time step of six hours. A second set of models integrated wind speed at the reference station to account for the sea breeze effect. The R² ranged between 0.770 and 0.932 for the training dataset and between 0.841 and 0.924 for the testing dataset, with the best performance attained right in correspondence of the city hot spots. Unexpectedly, very little benefit (0.06–0.43%) was achieved by including the sea breeze among the input variables. Overall, this study is insightful of a rather rare climatological case at the watershed between maritime and desertic typicality. We proved that accurate UHII predictions can be achieved by learning from long-term air temperature records, provided that an appropriate predicting architecture is utilized.","https://www.proquest.com/docview/2388759497?accountid=44943&bdid=84593&_bd=jNE8C8v7n2njVi3Yhnz7pDKLado%3D","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2019.136068"

Their main task is to monitor whether system performance remains within pre-specified ranges and intervention is only required in unusual situations. One of the consequences is a loss of situation awareness, which significantly affects performance in abnormal, time-critical situation. The present study reports two experiments, both dealing with fault management in a maritime supervisory control task. The first experiment investigated to what extent false alarms would affect performance and diagnosis behaviour when multiple disturbances occurred. Thirty-nine students from maritime curricula diagnosed disturbances that could either be real or turn out to be a false alarm. The presence of false alarms not only affected the rate with which the subsystems under control were sampled, but it also increased problem-solving time. One of the reasons for suboptimal performance in dealing with fault propagation was tunnel vision: participants had a tendency to deal with disturbances sequentially. In the second experiment the effect of support on performance and diagnosis behaviour was investigated. Two types of support were distinguished: interactive support requiring participants to provide the symptom values and automatic support that directly provided the correct action. Thirty students from maritime curricula diagnosed disturbances with the help of either the interactive or the noninteractive support tool. The results indicated that even though both support tools gave the same advice on how to act, more incorrect actions were taken in the non-interactive support condition. Even though no differences in performance were found after the tool had been removed, it was shown that participants who were used to interactive support used a more structured problem-solving strategy than participants used to the non-interactive support.

While the nonlinear USV working in the complex ocean environment, the good trajectory tracking performance is an important capacity. However, the nonlinearity, modeling uncertainties (e.g., modeling error and parameter variations) and external disturbance (wind, wave, current, etc) are the main difficulties, which deteriorates the control performance. To solve this issue, most existing algorithms for USV's tracking have been developed based on the linearization of the USV's nonlinear dynamic model at specific equilibrium point. However, the integrated effect of nonlinearities, modeling uncertainties and external disturbance has not been well considered, which can degrade the USV's tracking performance. Therefore, to achieve the good tracking performance for USV, a nonlinear dynamic model is strictly derived in this paper with the integrate consideration of abovementioned issues, and an adaptive sliding mode control design using RBFNN(Radial Basis Function Neural Network) and disturbance-observer is subsequently developed, where a RBFNN approximator is designed to approximate and compensate modeling uncertainties, and a disturbance-observer is designed to estimate and compensate the effect of the external disturbance. Furthermore, the global stability of the overall closed-loop system of USV are strictly guaranteed.

In the past decades, a huge amount of coal has been transported from these areas to the central and south China via ports in Hebei Province and Port of Tianjin. Traditionally, coal is transported in bulk shipment. However, in recent years, an interesting phenomenon is that the lump coal is sorted out in the north and then moved in containers to the south. This paper aims to ascertain whether the coal containerization will become an alternative transport mode for moving lump coal from the north to the south of China. Based on extensive field investigation and data analyses, it is found that although the container mode appears to be more expensive than the bulk shipping mode, the cost difference between the two modes is not as significant as our expectation if we also take into factors like fragmented demand, environment pressure, geographic distribution characteristics of customers and so on.Design/methodology/approachExtensive field investigation, data analysis and economic decision model.FindingsIt is found that although the container mode appears to be more expensive than the bulk shipping mode, the cost difference between the two modes is not as significant as the authors’ expectation if they also take into factors like fragmented demand, environment pressure, geographic distribution characteristics of customers and so on.Originality/valueAlthough the major focus has been placed on the food containerization, the coal containerization is still a new thing and has attracted only limited attention.

The latter fruits were exported by sea freight and analysed upon arrival at their destination and after post-harvest flavour genesis. Volatiles were analysed by headspace solid-phase microextraction, gas chromatography–mass spectrometry and multivariate statistical data analysis. Clear-cut differences in the volatile profiles were found. Fully ripe air-freighted pineapples were characterised by elevated concentrations of two 1,3,5,8-undecatetraene isomers, methyl 3-methylbutanoate and 4-methoxy-2,5-dimethyl-3(2H)-furanone, which have been reported as potent contributors to the pineapple flavour. Compared to fully ripened fruits, development of volatiles of sea-freighted pineapples upon arrival in Europe was rudimentary. Post-harvest storage of sea-freighted pineapples resulted in a different volatile profile due to the genesis of hydroxylated and acetoxylated methyl esters and hexanal. Subsequent descriptive sensory analysis was performed by trained panellists comparing retronasal odour and taste profiles. Fully ripe fruits were characterised by a pineapple-like note, fruity flavours and a sweet taste. In contrast, most of these attributes were rated at lower intensities when premature green-ripe fruits were tested. At the end of the post-harvest period, sea-freighted pineapples were characterised by fruity notes accompanied by a musty/corky- and cardboard-like off-flavour.

The convective processes accompanied with the sea ice formation result bottom water formation. The cold and dense bottom water moves towards the equator along the ocean basins and takes part in the global thermohaline circulation. Sea ice edge is a potential indicator of climate change. Additionally, fishing and commercial shipping activities as well as military submarine operations in the polar seas need reliable ice edge information. However, as the sea ice edge is unstable in time, the temporal validity of the estimated ice edge is often shorter than the time required to transfer the information to the operational user. Hence, an accurate sea ice edge prediction as well as determination is crucial for fine-scale geophysical modeling and for near-real-time operations. In this study, active contour modelling (known as Snake model) and non-rigid motion estimation techniques have been used for predicting the sea ice edge (SIE) in the Antarctic. For this purpose the SIE has been detected from sea ice concentration derived using special sensor microwave imager (SSM/I) observations. The 15% sea ice concentration pixels are being taken as the edge pixel between ice and water. The external force, gradient vector flow (GVF), of SIE for total the Antarctic region is parameterised for daily as well as weekly data set. The SIE is predicted at certain points using a statistical technique. These predicted points have been used to constitute a SIE using artificial intelligence technique, the gradient vector flow (GVF). The predicted edge has been validated with that of SSM/I.

Container terminals are service providers to cargo owners (i.e., shippers) as well as liner shipping firms (i.e., carriers) while priorities and requirements may differ. Terminal operators should define the equilibrium quality and configuration of terminal services subject to its own constraints (e.g., financial sustainability). The mainstream approach for evaluation of service quality needs to focus on a particular customer (or group of customers) ceteris paribus. In this paper, the multi-layer quality function deployment (ML-QFD) method is applied to the terminal operators in two-customer context (shippers and carriers). ML-QFD is capable of merging diversified perspectives of several customers and delivering an equilibrium outcome which may satisfy both stakeholders in a cooperative approach. Rather than indefinite superficial recommendations, ML-QFD gets to the point and finds specific technical measures which improve the intended problem. Empirical results (East Asian sample) indicate that both shippers and carriers fundamentally demand cheaper services while shippers also require rapid terminal operations in common with the literature. For achieving requirements of shippers and carriers (in equilibrium), the role of human resource management, operational excellence and automation are emphasised by subjects.","https://www.proquest.com/docview/1780506654?accountid=44943&bdid=84593&_bd=dI%2FBkFUbfnlFvOX0GRRrRZ6tiI8%3D","https://doi.org/10.1504/IJSTL.2016.075011"

Unfortunately, these vehicles are vulnerable to passive and active cyber‐physical attacks that can be used for industrial espionage and hijacking attempts. Since attackers can use hijacked vehicles as weapons in terrorist attacks, ensuring the secure operation of such vehicles is critical to prevent the attacks from causing dire financial consequences, or worse, the loss of human lives. This study is motivated by the observation that most cybersecurity studies provide superficial, high‐level descriptions of vulnerabilities and attacks, and the true impact of the described attacks remains unclear. To address this problem, we demonstrate advanced manipulation attacks against an underactuated Unmanned Surface Vehicle (USV) which results in successful hijackings. Using state‐of‐the‐art cryptography, we also show how the signal transmission can be secured to avoid hijacking attempts actively steering the vehicle off course. Through field experiments, we demonstrate how the attacks affect the closed‐loop guidance, navigation, and control system and how the proposed countermeasures prevent these attacks from being successful. Our study is unique in that we provide a complete description of the attacked USV and give a detailed analysis of how spoofed navigation estimates affect the closed‐loop behavior of the underactuated USV.","https://www.proquest.com/docview/2679602286?accountid=44943&bdid=84593&_bd=g4K6R7ha4mzglSP4sTTm87MXbuE%3D","https://doi.org/10.1002/rob.22068"

With developments in computation and artificial intelligence, it is increasingly important to measure and classify underwater ship signatures. In this work, we design an artificial neural network that classifies commercial ships based on their multi-influence signature. In total, 103 ship passages were included in the considered data set, with signatures recorded as the ship crossed a line of passive underwater sensors. The multi-influence signature was formed by feature-level sensor fusion of the hydroacoustic signature, the underwater electric potential, and the static and alternating magnetic signatures. Ships were classified according to size, or type, as broadcast on the AIS. With feature-level fusion, the neural network will optimize the relationship between different types of signatures, emphasizing features with greater predictive power. At the same time, weak features, even if not independently adequate for classification, can add information that improves accuracy further. The developed neural network achieved a classification accuracy of 87.4% when classifying according to size. With augmented data to balance the classes, 85.0% classification accuracy was achieved when classifying according to ship type. This is a large improvement on the found classification accuracy when using only hydroacoustic or electromagnetic signatures. This article verifies the value of feature-level sensor fusion in classification, and provides guidance on classifier design depending on the exact ship classification task.","https://www.proquest.com/docview/2513387342?accountid=44943&bdid=84593&_bd=Vhpewd0EuEjXVzydGU7%2BCXWRGcM%3D","https://doi.org/10.1109/JOE.2020.2982756"

Previous researchers mostly utilized the geometric, radiometric, and structural features combined with the traditional machine-learning (ML) methods to conduct ship classification in high-resolution (HR) SAR images. However, the handcrafted features showed weak representation for the medium-resolution (MR) SAR images, and the normal ML methods are less powerful to deal with the intraclass diversity and interclass similarity in the MR SAR ship images. To address these issues, this article extends the dense convolutional networks to the MR SAR ship classification for better deep features extraction and proposes a multitask learning framework within which the softmax log-loss and the triplet loss are jointly minimized for more effective ship classification in MR SAR images. The triplet loss is computed by imposing a similarity constraint on the deep embeddings via the deep metric learning (DML) scheme such that the deep representations of the same class are pulled much closer to each other and those from different classes are pushed as farther apart as possible. However, the triplet loss in the usual DML utilizes the triplets mined in a training batch independently, which ignores the contextual information. So, we propose to impose a Fisher discrimination regularization term on the deep embeddings to explore the global information of learned embeddings, and hence the designed task-specific networks will be trained to have more robust and better recognition performance. Extensive experiments on the MR SAR ship data set collected from the Sentinel-1 SAR images demonstrate that the proposed method can achieve superior performance for the 3- and 5-class recognition tasks with regard to the comparing CNN models.","https://www.proquest.com/docview/2505609089?accountid=44943&bdid=84593&_bd=ZWAKmu%2FHJ5A5FDKiwQw1b9zijBk%3D","https://doi.org/10.1109/TGRS.2020.3009284"

Moreover, the maritime industry has become increasingly data driven, making possible the advent of data-driven trim optimisation and machine learning algorithms that can deduce the relation between trim and power based upon data measured when a ship is in service. So technological progress has greatly expanded the options and potential for accuracy with trim optimisation. But another innovation, thrust measurements, can also help in trim optimisation.

Focusing on communications solutions with an emphasis on business applications, it is obvious to claim that business applications that are being deployed with 2.5G wireless networks fall into two general categories: (a) horizontal applications ""mobile office"" such as electronic mailing, voice communications, Internet access, short messaging and personal information management (PIM) tools and (b) vertical applications ""sales force automation""(SFA) and field force automation (FFA), fleet management, government communications and public safety, telemetry and remote monitoring, point-of-sale as well as financial services. The new generation of wireless devices being introduced to the market for 2.5G global system for mobile communications (GSM) and general packet radio service (GPRS) services is designed to support these applications, with features ranging from small standard keyboards to high resolutions rich colored screens. The impressive growth of cellular mobile telephony as well as the number of Internet users promises an exciting potential for a market that combines both innovations. The general packet radio service (GPRS) is a new non-voice value-added service that allows information to be sent and received across a mobile telephone network. Users of GPRS benefit from shorter access time and higher data rates. It is important to note that the standard GPRS network itself does not offer a reasonably secure solution for providing mobile access to a corporate local area network (LAN). Although, the air interface ciphering and the GPRS authentication process are secured, the IP traffic is unencrypted all the way from the serving GPRS support node (SGSN) to the corporate LAN gateway. The most feasible solution for secure remote connections would be to use an end-to-end virtual private network (VPN) solution from the mobile station (MS) to the corporate LAN gateway where the traffic is encrypted for the whole connection and the user can slip to the Internet from the nearest access point. It is important to separate the user traffic from the control traffic to guarantee high level of security with a minor impact on quality of service (QoS) which means providing consistent and predictable data delivery service that can lead to customer application requirement satisfaction. However, to achieve that security has to be looked at as the key player in the new GSM data networks when deploying GPRS. This paper demonstrates the case of Vodafone Egypt, one of the mobile operators, in deploying GPRS networks while focusing on exploring the business opportunities and motivating factors to implement GPRS.

As these efforts respect NATO's primary role in European defence, there is more scope for practical EU-US collaboration regarding crisis management and security assistance operations.

A careful experimental design was developed to characterize fugitive emissions produced by the integrated steel plant. A PM10 and PM2.5 monitoring campaign was conducted at three sampling sites around the steel plant, in order to perform a triangulation in the area surrounding the investigated site and evaluate its impact based on wind direction. Data analysis showed that the transport of air mass, from the steelworks to one of the receptor sites, resulted in ambient air concentrations of Fe, Mn, Zn and PAHs higher than those observed in the other two sites. Principal component analysis allowed the identification of four emission sources: coke ovens stack, mineral park, a crustal source and vanadium source. The first two sources were characterized by high concentrations of PAHs and metals and related to the steelworks, while the vanadium source was probably associated with maritime traffic in the port area. This preliminary monitoring approach proved effective in identifying the fugitive emission contribution of the steel plant to the surrounding air quality.","https://www.proquest.com/docview/1635015817?accountid=44943&bdid=84593&_bd=IxQHKwOds6GGF71R4SKJISBj2nY%3D","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.atmosenv.2013.07.001"

In particular, technological advances in industrial activities can give rise to improvement in productivity and in occupational health and safety, but not necessarily simultaneously. The beginning of the container transport dates back to 50years ago, but while containerization changed everything, from ships and ports to patterns of global trade, its impact on work injuries was not explored at all. The aim of this paper is to investigate the relationship between work organization, job experience, productivity and occupational accidents, from the starting of the container expansion to nowadays, considering Genoa port (Italy), one of the largest of the Mediterranean Sea. In order to minimize possible reporting biases, such as underreporting or reclassification to a lower level of severity, injury statistics are elaborated starting from data collected directly on-site, from internal accident or medical-aid reports. An in-depth statistical analysis on occupational injuries in the years 1980-2006 is carried out, with reference to frequency indexes, mechanism of injury and material causes. The increase of container-ships traffic and, consequently, the sharp change in port infrastructure involved a rapid modification also in the work organization, with particular reference to the number and characteristics of workforce (decrease from 5783 to nearly 1000 employees and increase of low experience workers from 28% to 74%). The striking high percentage increase of young or low experienced workers in handling container (and performing correlated new tasks) caused a remarkable increase of the risk for occupational injuries. In the studied port, we recorded an increase of the frequency index (injuries per hundred thousand hours worked) from 13.0 to 29.7. It results that the increased expansion of shipping container utilization is not connected to a correspondent human factor safety implementation. Main risk factors are pointed out, revealing an increase of accidents due to transport vehicle (+8.3%) and a reduction of accidents caused by substance or materials (a degree 4.5%). These factors show a statistical significant correlation with the new job tasks. Consideration of these findings may enable managerial solutions and workplace organization interventions for the prevention of injuries and safety performance improvement in port activities.","https://www.proquest.com/docview/759307598?accountid=44943&bdid=84593&_bd=4DZvXj9%2FrZv1bAWsiNHiNPG8nLY%3D","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ssci.2009.08.007"

What is less clear are the factors influencing the distribution of virus-specific lineages. Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) is the most important etiologic agent of epidemic encephalitis worldwide, and is primarily maintained between vertebrate reservoir hosts (avian and swine) and culicine mosquitoes. There are five genotypes of JEV: GI-V. In recent years, GI has displaced GIII as the dominant JEV genotype and GV has re-emerged after almost 60 years of undetected virus circulation. JEV is found throughout most of Asia, extending from maritime Siberia in the north to Australia in the south, and as far as Pakistan to the west and Saipan to the east. Transmission of JEV in temperate zones is epidemic with the majority of cases occurring in summer months, while transmission in tropical zones is endemic and occurs year-round at lower rates. To test the hypothesis that viruses circulating in these two geographical zones are genetically distinct, we applied Bayesian phylogeographic, categorical data analysis and phylogeny-trait association test techniques to the largest JEV dataset compiled to date, representing the envelope (E) gene of 487 isolates collected from 12 countries over 75 years. We demonstrated that GIII and the recently emerged GI-b are temperate genotypes likely maintained year-round in northern latitudes, while GI-a and GII are tropical genotypes likely maintained primarily through mosquito-avian and mosquito-swine transmission cycles. This study represents a new paradigm directly linking viral molecular evolution and climate. Although Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) is a major cause of death and disability throughout tropical and temperate Asia, little is known about the evolution, geographical distribution and epidemiology of the five JEV genotypes (genetically distinct groups). To address this gap in our knowledge, we performed a genetic-based geographical analysis using the largest JEV sequence dataset assembled to date, including 487 viral sequences sampled from 12 countries over 75 years. We showed that both the newly and previously dominant genotypes of JEV are associated with temperate climates and are maintained throughout the cold winter months in northern Asia, likely by hibernating mosquitoes (survive throughout the winter), vertical transmission in mosquitoes (female to offspring), cold-blooded vertebrates and/or bats.","https://www.proquest.com/docview/1448218186?accountid=44943&bdid=84593&_bd=b3aD9px1Ch0b6KkzMk2oJXkI2CM%3D","https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pntd.0002411"

In US waters, snow crabs are found throughout the Arctic and sub-Arctic seas surrounding Alaska, north of the Aleutian Islands, yet commercial harvest currently focuses on the more southerly population in the Bering Sea. Population dynamics are well-monitored in exploited areas, but few data exist for populations further north where climate trends in the Arctic appear to be affecting species' distributions and community structure on multiple trophic levels. Moreover, increased shipping traffic, as well as fisheries and petroleum resource development, may add additional pressures in northern portions of the range as seasonal ice cover continues to decline. In the face of these pressures, we examined the ecological niche and population distribution of snow crabs in Alaskan waters using a GIS-based spatial modeling approach. We present the first quantitative open-access model predictions of snow-crab distribution, abundance, and biomass in the Chukchi and Beaufort Seas. Multi-variate analysis of environmental drivers of species' distribution and community structure commonly rely on multiple linear regression methods. The spatial modeling approach employed here improves upon linear regression methods in allowing for exploration of nonlinear relationships and interactions between variables. Three machine-learning algorithms were used to evaluate relationships between snow-crab distribution and environmental parameters, including TreeNet, Random Forests, and MARS. An ensemble model was then generated by combining output from these three models to generate consensus predictions for presence-absence, abundance, and biomass of snow crabs. Each algorithm identified a suite of variables most important in predicting snow-crab distribution, including nutrient and chlorophyll-a concentrations in overlying waters, temperature, salinity, and annual sea-ice cover; this information may be used to develop and test hypotheses regarding the ecology of this species. This is the first such quantitative model for snow crabs, and all GIS-data layers compiled for this project are freely available from the authors, upon request, for public use and improvement.

Civilian research in this area has to date been relatively limited; standards covering the measurement of radiated noise from ships in deep water and associated data analysis procedures have only recently been published by national and international standards institutes. Less attention has so far been paid to the measurement of radiated noise from ships in shallow water environments. This is of interest as shallow water areas are more likely to be used by civilian researchers due to the logistical problems involved in undertaking trials in deep water.

In many jurisdictions, management strategies are being developed in an attempt to reduce the environmental and economic harm these species may cause in the receiving ecosystem. Scientific studies to improve understanding of the mechanisms behind invasive species population growth and spread are key components in the development of control methods. The work presented herein is motivated by the case of the European green crab (Carcinus maenas L.), a remarkably adaptable organism that has invaded marine coastal waters around the globe. Two genotypes of European green crab have independently invaded the Atlantic coast of Canada. One genotype invaded the mid-Atlantic coast of the USA by 1817, subsequently spreading northward through New England and reaching Atlantic Canada by 1951. A second genotype, originating from the northern limit of the green crabs European range, invaded the Atlantic coast of Nova Scotia in the 1980s and is spreading southward from the Canadian Maritime provinces. We developed an integrodifference equation model for green crab population growth, competition and spread, and demonstrate that it yields appropriate spread rates for the two genotypes, based on historical data. Analysis of our model indicates that while harvesting efforts have the benefit of reducing green crab density and slowing the spread rate of the two genotypes, elimination of the green crab is virtually impossible with harvesting alone. Accordingly, a green crab fishery would be sustainable. We also demonstrate that with harvesting and restocking, the competitive imbalance between the Northern and Southern green crab genotypes can be reversed. That is, a competitively inferior species can be used to control a competitively superior one.","https://www.proquest.com/docview/1611614170?accountid=44943&bdid=84593&_bd=RWMUOrNKMSEo33bZntAr4cektT8%3D","https://doi.org/10.1007/s12080-014-0226-8"

The industrial harbour at Kitimat (British Columbia, Canada) provides an ideal location to study the bioavailability and bioaccumulation of sediment hydrocarbons to low trophic level biota. Samples of soft shell clams (Mya arenaria) and intertidal sediment collected from multiple sites over six years at various distances from an aluminium smelter and a pulp and paper mill were analysed for 106 PAHs, plant diterpenes and other aromatic fraction hydrocarbons. Interpretation using PAH source ratios and multivariate data analysis reveals six principal hydrocarbon sources: PAHs in coke, pitch and emissions from anode combustion from the aluminium smelter, vascular plant terpenes and aromatised terpenes from the pulp and paper mill, petroleum PAHs from shipping and other anthropogenic activities and PAHs from natural plant detritus. Harbour sediments predominantly contain either pitch or pyrogenic PAHs from the smelter, while clams predominantly contain plant derived PAHs and diterpenes from the adjacent pulp mill. PAHs from the smelter have low bioavailability to clams (Biota-Sediment Accumulation Factors; BSAFs <1 for pitch and coke; <10 for anode combustion, decreasing to -0.1 for the mass 300 and 302 PAHs), possibly due to binding to pitch or soot carbon matrices. Decreases in PAH isomer ratios between sediments and clams likely reflect a combination of variation in uptake kinetics of petroleum PAHs and compound specific metabolism, with the importance of petroleum PAHs decreasing with increasing molecular weight. Plant derived compounds exhibit little natural bioaccumulation at reference sites, but unsaturated and aromatised diterpenes released from resins by industrial pulping processes are readily accumulated by the clams (BSAFs >500). Thus while most of the smelter associated PAHs in sediments may not be bioavailable to benthic organisms, the plant terpenes (including retene, totarol, ferruginol, manool, dehydroabietane and other plant terpenes that form the chemical defence mechanism of conifers) released by pulp mills are bioavailable and possess demonstrated toxic properties. The large scale release of plant terpenes by some of the many pulp mills located in British Columbia and elsewhere represents a largely undocumented risk to aquatic biota.","https://www.proquest.com/docview/1642326596?accountid=44943&bdid=84593&_bd=Y2OjnKv45%2BzfOr64aUp6FFk%2FErY%3D","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.marenvres.2011.06.004"

Over the last century, plague ecology has transitioned through cycles of widespread human transmission, urban domestic transmission among commensal rodents, and ultimately settled into the predominantly sylvan foci that remain today where it is maintained alternatively by enzootic and epizootic transmission. While zoonotic transmission to humans is much less common in modern times, significant plague risk remains in parts of the western US. Moreover, risk to some threatened species that are part of the epizootic cycle can be quite substantive. This investigation attempted to predict the risk of plague across the western US by modeling the ecologic niche of plague in sylvan and domestic animals identified between 2000 and 2015. A Maxent machine learning algorithm was used to predict this niche based on climate, altitude, land cover, and the presence of an important enzootic species, Peromyscus maniculatus. This model demonstrated good predictive ability (AUC = 86%) and identified areas of high risk in central Colorado, north-central New Mexico, and southwestern and northeastern California. The presence of P. maniculatus, altitude, precipitation during the driest and wettest quarters, and distance to artificial surfaces, all contributed substantively to maximizing the gain function. These findings add to the known landscape epidemiology and infection ecology of plague in the western US and may suggest locations of particular risk to be targeted for wild and domestic animal intervention.","https://www.proquest.com/docview/1752586667?accountid=44943&bdid=84593&_bd=jSGiTX0cPciNbMqxun7GF4pbAWQ%3D","https://doi.org/10.7717/peerj.1493"

In particular, technological advances in industrial activities can give rise to improvement in productivity and in occupational health and safety, but not necessarily simultaneously. The beginning of the container transport dates back to 50years ago, but while containerization changed everything, from ships and ports to patterns of global trade, its impact on work injuries was not explored at all. The aim of this paper is to investigate the relationship between work organization, job experience, productivity and occupational accidents, from the starting of the container expansion to nowadays, considering Genoa port (Italy), one of the largest of the Mediterranean Sea. In order to minimize possible reporting biases, such as underreporting or reclassification to a lower level of severity, injury statistics are elaborated starting from data collected directly on-site, from internal accident or medical-aid reports. An in-depth statistical analysis on occupational injuries in the years 1980-2006 is carried out, with reference to frequency indexes, mechanism of injury and material causes. The increase of container-ships traffic and, consequently, the sharp change in port infrastructure involved a rapid modification also in the work organization, with particular reference to the number and characteristics of workforce (decrease from 5783 to nearly 1000 employees and increase of low experience workers from 28% to 74%). The striking high percentage increase of young or low experienced workers in handling container (and performing correlated new tasks) caused a remarkable increase of the risk for occupational injuries. In the studied port, we recorded an increase of the frequency index (injuries per hundred thousand hours worked) from 13.0 to 29.7. It results that the increased expansion of shipping container utilization is not connected to a correspondent human factor safety implementation. Main risk factors are pointed out, revealing an increase of accidents due to transport vehicle (+8.3%) and a reduction of accidents caused by substance or materials (a degree 4.5%). These factors show a statistical significant correlation with the new job tasks. Consideration of these findings may enable managerial solutions and workplace organization interventions for the prevention of injuries and safety performance improvement in port activities.","https://www.proquest.com/docview/1671243928?accountid=44943&bdid=84593&_bd=mbe0yJEjKIK9wPfqeMcztvsXnT8%3D","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ssci.2009.08.007"

Radiated underwater noise from ships, primarily resulting from propeller cavitation, has for many years been understood to be one of the major contributors to ambient ocean noise. Civilian research in this area has to date been relatively limited; standards covering the measurement of radiated noise from ships in deep water and associated data analysis procedures have only recently been published by national and international standards institutes. Less attention has so far been paid to the measurement of radiated noise from ships in shallow water environments. This is of interest as shallow water areas are more likely to be used by civilian researchers due to the logistical problems involved in undertaking trials in deep water. The issue of shipping noise has been identified as one requiring further research, indicated by the recent funding of several large collaborative projects by the EU (e.g. the SILENV, AQUO and SONIC projects). This paper presents ship radiated noise data measured using a three hydrophone array during a sea trial undertaken as part of the SONIC project.","https://www.proquest.com/docview/1825461254?accountid=44943&bdid=84593&_bd=KKa%2Bve1Mj8um2H92ptpITb21Sno%3D","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.oceaneng.2015.09.048"

Data analysis using a mixed model (REML) with time as the fixed effect and portion as a random effect, showed that the only beef quality trait that changed during storage was total volatile basic nitrogen (TVBN; P < .05), which reached the threshold of 15 mg/100 g between 15 and 20 weeks (including 5 weeks of transport). The total viable count (TVC) accounted for 78% of the variance in TVBN, when storage time was included in the model.

After 9 weeks, Carnobacterium spp. and Lactobacillus spp. dominated alternately and then Lactobacillus became the most prevalent bacteria. An operational taxominc unit based hierarchical cluster analysis using the unweighted pair-group method with arithmetic means was performed and it was shown that the bacterial communities tended to be consistent as storage time extended.

The aim of the present study was to use the bioagent transport and environmental modeling system (BioTEMS) to identify the potential for arbovirus-infected Aedes species to invade the Chabahar area in southeastern Iran.METHODSArcGIS geospatial analysis software, Statistica software, and BioTEMS were used to analyze geographic information and conduct data analysis. BioTEMS utilizes up to several hundred abiotic and biotic factors to produce risk and vulnerability assessments for biological agents and infectious diseases. The output of BioTEMS was validated using published predictive models, and most importantly published collection data of Aedes species in Iran.RESULTSThere appears to have been two separate invasion events by Ae. albopictus into the southern region of Iran, first preceding 2009 and then again in 2013. BioTEMS identified two probable areas of introduction during the 2009 time frame, either through one or both the Chabahar ports or the Iranshahr airport with subsequent spread through vehicular transport. BioTEMS identified the port as an introduction zone for ZIKAV with high-risk zones and identifies gap zones during the 2013 time frame. Recommended surveillance sites are provided.CONCLUSIONThe air and maritime ports of Iran serve international customers, and are therefore vulnerable to import and invasion of mosquito vectors and arboviruses.

The effectiveness of the use of valve generator sets and the transition to the distribution of dc electric energy is shown. New-generation static power sources are actively developing in maritime transport. Good adjusting characteristics, an unrestricted number of reverses and minimum speed, high efficiency when working at fractional loads, and high propeller torque capacity significantly expand the applicable scope of modern ac electric propulsion systems. The desire to combine the advantages of different types of propulsion plants facilitated the creation of combined (hybrid) propulsion plants. Combined plants combine a traditional main thermal engine and a propeller motor. A main thermal or propeller electric motor is used depending on the operating mode and the vessel speed. It is concluded that the main tasks in the development of maritime electrical engineering are increasing the energy efficiency of electricity generation by introducing valve generator sets, innovative sources of electricity with high efficiency and environmental friendliness, permanent magnet and inductor-type propeller motors, and combined propulsion machinery with reversible electric propulsion systems.","https://www.proquest.com/docview/2540115587?accountid=44943&bdid=84593&_bd=ior0If3sNFxmPw6auL8LTIPUEoU%3D","https://doi.org/10.3103/S1068371221030111"

In US waters, snow crabs are found throughout the Arctic and sub-Arctic seas surrounding Alaska, north of the Aleutian Islands, yet commercial harvest currently focuses on the more southerly population in the Bering Sea. Population dynamics are well-monitored in exploited areas, but few data exist for populations further north where climate trends in the Arctic appear to be affecting species’ distributions and community structure on multiple trophic levels. Moreover, increased shipping traffic, as well as fisheries and petroleum resource development, may add additional pressures in northern portions of the range as seasonal ice cover continues to decline. In the face of these pressures, we examined the ecological niche and population distribution of snow crabs in Alaskan waters using a GIS-based spatial modeling approach. We present the first quantitative open-access model predictions of snow-crab distribution, abundance, and biomass in the Chukchi and Beaufort Seas. Multi-variate analysis of environmental drivers of species’ distribution and community structure commonly rely on multiple linear regression methods. The spatial modeling approach employed here improves upon linear regression methods in allowing for exploration of nonlinear relationships and interactions between variables. Three machine-learning algorithms were used to evaluate relationships between snow-crab distribution and environmental parameters, including TreeNet, Random Forests, and MARS. An ensemble model was then generated by combining output from these three models to generate consensus predictions for presence–absence, abundance, and biomass of snow crabs. Each algorithm identified a suite of variables most important in predicting snow-crab distribution, including nutrient and chlorophyll-a concentrations in overlying waters, temperature, salinity, and annual sea-ice cover; this information may be used to develop and test hypotheses regarding the ecology of this species. This is the first such quantitative model for snow crabs, and all GIS-data layers compiled for this project are freely available from the authors, upon request, for public use and improvement.","https://www.proquest.com/docview/1803073981?accountid=44943&bdid=84593&_bd=i%2Bh5KchDQ9PMXcWl5V3TLESU9Gs%3D","https://doi.org/10.1093/icb/icr102"

However, the unusually heavy Mei-yu and flood in 2020 were preceded only by a weak El Niño in the central equatorial Pacific, and thus caught many forecasters by surprise. Here we try to find the cause of this peculiarity through data analysis and a set of model experiments. Our results indicate that the positive Indian Ocean basin mode (IOBM) and the sudden decay of the CP El Niño in mid-2020 significantly contributed to ascending anomaly over the Maritime Continent, which enhanced the subtropical high over the South China Sea and the convergence over the YRV. It is the zonal temperature gradient across the tropical Indo-Pacific Ocean before and during the mei-yu season, rather than the magnitude of the preceding El Niño or Indian Ocean warming, that determines the strength and duration of the Mei-yu.

Depending on the plant genotype, the maturation of the cutting, and the particular environment, which is complex and often involves intermediate storage of cuttings under dark conditions and shipping between different climate regions, induced senescence or abscission of leaves and insufficient root development can impair the success of propagation and the quality of generated young plants. Recent findings on the molecular and physiological control of leaf vitality and adventitious root formation are integrated into a systemic perspective on improved physiologically-based control of cutting propagation. The homeostasis and signal transduction of the wound responsive plant hormones ethylene and jasmonic acid, of auxin, cytokinins and strigolactones, and the carbon-nitrogen source-sink balance in cuttings are considered as important processes that are both, highly responsive to environmental inputs and decisive for the development of cuttings. Important modules and bottlenecks of cutting function are identified. Critical environmental inputs at stock plant and cutting level are highlighted and physiological outputs that can be used as quality attributes to monitor the functional capacity of cuttings and as response parameters to optimize the cutting environment are discussed. Facing the great genetic diversity of ornamental crops, a physiologically targeted approach is proposed to define bottleneck-specific plant groups.

Pointwise uncertainty values are needed for modeling and data analysis and should include all the random errors affecting each data point. Total uncertainty can be decomposed into two primary components: analytical measurement uncertainty and sampling uncertainty. Analytical measurement uncertainties are relatively easy to calculate from routine quality control (QC) data. Sampling uncertainties, on the other hand, are comparatively difficult to measure. in this paper, the authors describe data from collocated samplers to provide a snapshot of whole-system uncertainty for several important chemical species. The components of uncertainty were evaluated for key species from each of the analytical methods employed by the PM2.5 Speciation Trends Network (STN) program: gravimetry, ion chromatography (IC), X-ray fluorescence (XRF), and thermal-optical analysis for organic carbon and elemental carbon. The results show that the laboratory measurement uncertainties are typically very small compared with uncertainties calculated from the differences between samples collected from collocated samplers. These differences are attributable to the ""field"" components uncertainty, which may include contamination and/or losses during shipping, handling, and sampling, as well as other distortions of the concentration level due to flow and sample volume variations. Uncertainties calculated from the collocation results were found to be generally similar to the uncertainties currently being loaded into EPA's AQS system, with some exceptions described below.","https://www.proquest.com/docview/20639479?accountid=44943&bdid=84593&_bd=Cr%2FkiZxV3zwxi8ZwRIIvalhoE9U%3D",""

The use of the AIS data enables the positioning of ship emissions with a high spatial resolution, which is limited only by the inaccuracies of the Global Positioning System (typically a few metres) that is used in vessel navigation. The emissions are computed based on the relationship of the instantaneous speed to the design speed, and these computations also take into account the detailed technical information of the ships' engines. The modelling of emissions is also based on a few basic equations of ship design, including the modelling of the propelling power of each vessel in terms of its speed. We have also investigated the effect of waves on the consumption of fuel, and on the emissions to the atmosphere. The predictions of fuel consumption were compared with the actual values obtained from the shipowners. For a RoPax vessel, the predicted and reported values of fuel consumption agreed within an accuracy of 6%. According to the data analysis and model computations, the emissions of NO sub(x), SO sub(x) and CO sub(2) originating from ships in the Baltic Sea in 2007 were in total 400 kt, 138 kt and 19 Mt, respectively. A breakdown of emissions by flag state, ship's type and year of construction is also presented. The modelling system can be used as a decision support tool in the case of issues concerning, e.g., health effects caused by shipping emissions, the construction of emission-based fairway dues systems or emissions trading. The computation of emissions can also be automated, which will save resources in constructing emission inventories. Both the methodologies and the emission computation program can be applied in any sea region in the world, provided that the AIS data from that specific region are available.","https://www.proquest.com/docview/21070907?accountid=44943&bdid=84593&_bd=uubgL7KDIlqXLoFl16Xt0G%2FeIJo%3D",""

This region has been experiencing accelerating erosion and warmer temperatures, permafrost thawing, more frequent and intense storm surges, and increased maritime traffic and extractive industries with ice loss, with direct or cascading effects on the mixed ethnic and indigenous communities. This paper used engagement activities (Participatory Applied Theater) and qualitative approaches (focus groups) during three consecutive summers 2016–2018 to evaluate the risk perceptions and interpretations towards coastal changes and relocation as an adaptive response in this U.S. strategic yet remote location. Each focus group session started with risk ranking activities about regional hazards to assess knowledge and perceptions of risk, followed by an interactive script reading of an Iñupiat disaster legend to facilitate discussion about risk reduction options and engagement with the survey questions. Focus groups were audio recorded, transcribed, and analyzed using qualitative data analysis software Nvivo and a hybrid coding strategy. Results indicate that relocation is considered by some participants but is not planned for nor implemented by community groups, families, or the local government to reduce the hazard risks. However, widespread recognition of accelerated hazards and environmental changes, and the need for adaptation could lead to consideration of relocation in the future. This study provides a case of disaster risk reduction in a remote place with unique place-specific characteristics (e.g., particular forms of subsistence, corporate monopolies, Traditional Ecological Knowledge, and social organizations), but also shaped by significant external influences, accompanied by a changing landscape of risk from the slow and rapid onset of environmental changes.","https://www.proquest.com/docview/2723130764?accountid=44943&bdid=84593&_bd=CuO9zGYXhCOVOujFQnPoZisnSdE%3D","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.crm.2022.100460"

This review is interlinked with a qualitative data analysis based on semi-structured interviews with representatives of ocean carriers, which are key actors determining empty container repositioning. Empirical evidence obtained from fieldwork in the Czech Republic, albeit limited, is used to illustrate empty repositioning management by ocean carriers in the Central and Eastern Europe (CEE) landlocked hinterlands, which have been neglected in research with a specific geographic scope. By addressing the research questions and conducting the analysis, the authors determine whether empty container repositioning is a problem only concerning equipment allocation by an ocean carrier or requires a collaborative resolution involving various parties engaged in container movements in landlocked hinterlands. This article confirms that most existing literature dealing with empty container repositioning ignores the actual dynamics of landlocked hinterlands as well as business practitioners' perspective. The authors' analysis of the empirical research complements and challenges the reviewed research studies. Based on the analysis, ocean carriers seem to be unwilling to revise their actual container management strategies focused on maritime repositioning, disregarding the potential and importance of intermodal repositioning approaches based on market collaboration.

This disorder is of commercial importance since shipping of peaches to distant markets and storage before selling require low temperature. However, knowledge about the molecular basis of peach woolliness is still incomplete. To address this issue, a nylon macroarray containing 847 non-redundant expressed sequence tags (ESTs) from a ripe peach fruit cDNA library was developed and used. Gene expression changes of peach fruit (Prunus persica cv. O'Henry) ripened for 7 d at 21 °C (juicy fruit) were compared with those of fruit stored for 15 d at 4 °C and then ripened for 7 d at 21 °C (woolly fruit). A total of 106 genes were found to be differentially expressed between juicy and woolly fruit. Data analysis indicated that the activity of most of these genes (>90%) was repressed in the woolly fruit. In cold-stored peaches (cv. O'Henry), the expression level of selected genes (cobra, endopolygalacturonase, cinnamoyl-CoA-reductase, and rab11) was lower than in the juicy fruit, and it remained low in woolly peaches after ripening, a pattern that was conserved in woolly fruit from two other commercial cultivars (cv. Flamekist and cv. Elegant Lady). In addition, the results of this study indicate that molecular changes during fruit woolliness involve changes in the expression of genes associated with cell wall metabolism and endomembrane trafficking. Overall, the results reported here provide an initial characterization of the transcriptome activity of peach fruit under different post-harvest treatments.","https://www.proquest.com/docview/235018149?accountid=44943&bdid=84593&_bd=gj0BYeCxliUSjmp7bUL%2Bwpremlg%3D","https://doi.org/10.1093/jxb/ern069"

The study analyses a hazard identification model of winter navigation and reviews accident data extracted from four winter periods. These are adopted as a basis for visualizing the risks in winter navigation operations. The results reveal that experts consider ship independent navigation in ice conditions the most complex navigational operation, which is confirmed by accident data analysis showing that the operation constitutes the type of navigation with the highest number of accidents reported. The severity of the accidents during winter navigation is mainly categorized as less serious. Collision is the most typical accident in ice navigation and general cargo the type of vessel most frequently involved in these accidents. Consolidated ice, ice ridges and ice thickness between 15 and 40cm represent the most common ice conditions in which accidents occur.

First, a set of freight impedance functions was developed for different types of links of the waterway network, considering a number of factors (e.g. cargo type, delays at ship locks, water levels and flows at different waterway segments and upstream and downstream shipping speeds). Distance-based (DB) and time-based (TB) impedance matrices of different types of cargo were computed. A gravity model (GM) and an intervening opportunity model were then used to simulate the distributions of different types of cargo based on the computed impedance matrices. A trip length distribution method was applied to validate the estimated distribution models. The results showed that the GM with a power term outperformed the other models and that the TB models were superior to the DB models for the prediction of freight distributions over large geographies like the YREB.

This database contains marine accidents organized by ship and variable. The majority of variables are non-metric and some have never been analyzed because of the large number of values. Summary statistics were employed in the data analysis. In order to develop a conceptual model, the database variables were clustered into eleven main categories or constructs, which were organized according to their properties and connected with the path diagram of relationships. For demonstration purposes, one non-metric and five metric variables were selected, namely fatality, ship's properties (i.e. age, gross register tonnage, and length), number of people on board, and marine accidents. These were analyzed using the structural equation modeling (SEM) approach. The combined prediction power of the 'ship's properties' and 'number of people on board' independent variables accounted for 65% of the variance of the fatality. The model development was largely based on the data contained in the Swedish database. However, as this database shares a number of variables in common with other databases in the region and the world, the model presented in this paper could be applied to other datasets.

Analysis of the GPCC precipitation shows a dipolar structure of wet southwest versus dry central and northeast in precipitation anomalies associated with El Nino over Borneo Island during the austral summer [December-February (DJF)]. By using the 0.25 degree and 3-hourly CMORPH precipitation, it is found that rainfall over Borneo is strongly affected by the diurnal cycle of land-sea breezes. The spatial distribution of rainfall over Borneo depends on the direction of monsoonal winds. Weather typing analysis indicates that the dipolar structure of rainfall anomalies associated with ENSO is caused by the variability in the frequency of occurrence of different weather types. Rainfall is enhanced in the coastal region where sea breezes head against off-shore synoptic-scale low-level winds (i.e., in the lee side or wake area of the island), which is referred to here as the ""wake effect."" In DJF of El Nino years, the northwesterly austral summer monsoon in southern Borneo is weaker than normal over the Maritime Continent and easterly winds are more frequent than normal over Borneo, acting to enhance rainfall over the southwest coast of the island. This coastal rainfall generation mechanism in different weather types explains the dipole pattern of a wet southwest versus dry northeast in the rainfall anomalies over Borneo Island in the El Nino years.","https://www.proquest.com/docview/1671519980?accountid=44943&bdid=84593&_bd=wHrfFBNd4v4dQ5Ww20NprkzrpS4%3D","https://doi.org/10.1175/JCLI-D-12-00178.1"

Water samples were collected monthly during 2015 from the mainstream section of the river and its right bank tributaries flowing through the RRD. In general, [delta]18O and [delta]2H river signatures were depleted in summer-autumn (May-October) and elevated in winter-spring (November-April), displaying seasonal variation in response to regional monsoon air mass contest. The Pacific equatorial-maritime air mass dominates in summer and the northern Asia continental air mass controls in winter. Results show that water of the RRD tributaries stems solely from local sources and is completely separated from water arriving from upstream subbasins. This separation is due to the extensive management of the RRD (e.g., dykes and dams) for the purposes of irrigation and inundation prevention. Mainstream river section [delta]18O and [delta]2H compositions range from -10.58 and -73.74[per thousand] to -6.80 and -43.40[per thousand], respectively, and the corresponding ranges inside the RRD were from -9.35 and -64.27[per thousand] to -2.09 and -15.80[per thousand]. A combination of data analysis and hydrological simulation confirms the role of upstream hydropower reservoirs in retaining and mixing upstream water. River water inside the RRD experienced strong evaporation characterized by depleted d-excess values, becoming negative in summer. On the other hand, the main stream of the Red River has d-excess values around 10[per thousand], indicating moderate evaporation. Hydrograph separation shows that in upstream subbasins, the groundwater fraction dominates the river flow composition, especially during low flow regimes. Inside the RRD, the river receives groundwater during the dry season, whereas groundwater replenishment occurs in the rainy season. Annual evaporation obtained from this hydrograph separation computation was about 6.3% of catchment discharge, the same order as deduced from the difference between subbasin precipitation and discharge values. This study shows the necessity to re-evaluate empirical approaches in large river hydrology assessment schemes, especially in the context of climate change.","https://www.proquest.com/docview/1952328103?accountid=44943&bdid=84593&_bd=ZkZBjrWuUKeBYfSAFTSiC2VDvbQ%3D","https://doi.org/10.1002/hyp.11296"

A PM10 and PM2.5 monitoring campaign was conducted at three sampling sites around the steel plant, in order to perform a triangulation in the area surrounding the investigated site and evaluate its impact based on wind direction. Data analysis showed that the transport of air mass, from the steelworks to one of the receptor sites, resulted in ambient air concentrations of Fe, Mn, Zn and PAHs higher than those observed in the other two sites. Principal component analysis allowed the identification of four emission sources: coke ovens stack, mineral park, a crustal source and vanadium source. The first two sources were characterized by high concentrations of PAHs and metals and related to the steelworks, while the vanadium source was probably associated with maritime traffic in the port area.

Monitoring of lake ice extent and ice phenology (i.e. dates associated with freeze-up/break-up and ice duration) is also valuable for improving numerical weather prediction (NWP) and for climate monitoring. The availability of free synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data from the European Space Agency’s Sentinel-1 A/B constellation provides an unprecedented opportunity to develop operational algorithms for lake ice cover mapping at a temporal frequency not available until now from SAR missions (ca. every 1–5 days depending on latitude). For NWP, rapid and accurate mapping of ice cover and open water areas in lake-rich regions is required. However, the classification of SAR imagery using traditional machine learning (ML) approaches is challenging due to the large data volume generated by imaging systems such as Sentinel-1 SAR as well as the complexity of radar signatures as a function of sensor and target characteristics. For lakes specifically, radar backscatter can vary greatly with incidence angle, polarization and surface properties (e.g. calm and wind-roughed open water, new thin ice, surface roughness due to the presence of pressure ridges, ice type, melting of ice and on-ice snow). To address the challenge of large-scale lake ice mapping, we investigate the GPU-boosted deep neural network approach that is efficient at handling big complex data. In this paper, we design a novel maximum a posterior (MAP) approach combining a convolutional neural network (CNN) and conditional random field (CRF) for better addressing the challenges of operational lake ice mapping. The proposed approach is tested on 17 Sentinel-1 dual-polarization (VV and VH) SAR images, where eight are used for training and validation and nine used for out-of-sample testing. To identify the optimal network architecture, an independent validation set is used to evaluate the performance of a series of six CNNs with increasing model complexity. The best model overcomes the noise effect in Sentinel-1 SAR imagery and the lake ice signature ambiguity issue; it achieves average classification accuracies of 97.10% and 97.14% for open water and ice, respectively, on the validation set. Moreover, the best model outperforms the last-ranked model by about 2% in terms of mean overall accuracy (OA), demonstrating the improvement and importance of model selection. The use of CRF can consistently improve the CNN by reducing the artefacts and noise effect in ice maps, outperforming the CNN model when used alone by about 3% in terms of mean OA on the validation set. The proposed CNN-CRF approach also achieves high accuracy on the nine test scenes, achieving a mean OA of 93.10%, demonstrating strong generalization capability that is important for SAR lake ice mapping.","https://www.proquest.com/docview/2636391583?accountid=44943&bdid=84593&_bd=5QlUB9D8ZJ2hCdm1R3Z%2FsqbntjY%3D","https://doi.org/10.1080/01431161.2021.1995074"

Hence, prevention and control of air pollution is an urgent need in China, and air pollution prediction can provide reliable information for this process. Therefore, it is essential to establish effective air pollution prediction with an early warning model. Currently, one widely used air pollution prediction technology is the error correction model. However, this traditional method does not use data preprocessing technology. Therefoere, this paper presents an improved hybrid model named CEEMD-SLM-ECM (Complementary Set Empirical Mode Decomposition-Statistical Learning Model-Error Correction Model), which used the CEEMD data preprocessing technology together with statistical learning models. Furthermore, selected AQI (air quality index) data of 17 port cities in the 21st Century Maritime Silk Road Economic Belt were selected to test the forecasting ability of the proposed model. Data analysis shows that the CEEMD-SLM-ECM model has much higher accuracy compared with the traditional error correction model. So, the CEEMD-SLM-ECM is a very effective predictive model that can provide accurate prediction for air quality early warning.","https://www.proquest.com/docview/2431845094?accountid=44943&bdid=84593&_bd=q9Ng9dwVCwcduMaeSul4PO5m%2F3Q%3D","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.chemosphere.2020.126474"

Assuming an atmosphere-ocean system with an anisotropic Cox-Munk sea surface, the radiance and linear polarization in the upwelling radiation have been numerically evaluated for several typical aerosol models by using the adding and doubling method, in which multiple scatterings within the atmosphere and, multiple reflections at the atmosphere-ocean interface are fully taken into account. Major results based on this study are summarized as follows, (1) For the first time, the Medimar airborne POLDER data was analyzed from the linear polarization point of view by this study. Several typical aerosol models, namely, the Haze M, water-soluble, oceanic, maritime, continental and Junge-type models were fully tested against both the observed reflectance and linear polarization data at 0.85 mum in the principal plane, as well as in the image form with various viewing angle information. (2) By examining various combinations of aerosol's complex refractive indices and wind speeds, the authors found that only the water-soluble model and Junge-type models with nu=3.5, 4.0, and 4.5 can satisfy the observed reflectance data, but they also found that these models, satisfying the observed reflectance constraints, fail to satisfy the observed linear polarization features in the backward scattering directions. (3) Any aerosol models deduced from the reflectance data analysis should be tested against the polarization data. This study was the first such attempt and all the major aerosol models with a single-peaked size distribution function were rejected, as an appropriate model over the Mediterranean Sea at the Medimar experiment time because they all failed to satisfy the observed polarization data.

As early indicators of environmental change, they play a crucial role in water quality management. Human activities like climate change, eutrophication, or international shipping traffic strongly impact diversity of these organisms. Phytoplankton monitoring is a crucial step in the recognition of changes in community composition. The common standard for monitoring programs is manual microscopic counting, which strongly limits sample number and sampling frequency. In contrast, high‐throughput technologies like standard flow cytometry (FCM) are restricted to a low taxonomic resolution, which makes them unsuitable for the identification of indicator species. Imaging flow cytometers (IFC) could overcome these limitations as they combine microscopy and high‐throughput analysis. In comparison to single fluorescence values, image information not only allows for a wide variety of possibilities to characterize different species as well as immediate and fast measurements but also provides an archivable data output. Taxonomic resolution of IFC (ImageStream X Mk II) was proven comparable to standard FCM (FACSAria II) by the help of numerical evaluations. This is demonstrated on different levels of taxonomic differentiation of laboratory grown cultures in this study. Phytoplankton species discrimination by an imaging flow cytometer could be useful as supportive tool to make machine‐learning classifications more robust, reliable, and flexible. Furthermore, this study provides examples, demonstrating the possibility of discrimination between species with similar fluorescence properties, strains, and even subpopulations. In contrast to standard FCM, each cell is not only represented as a dot in a cytogram but is also linked to microscopic brightfield and the author presents a new way to visualize this as image‐based cytograms.

However, with the rapid development of satellite remote sensing technology, remote sensing data have gradually begun to show the characteristics of “big data”; additionally, the accuracy and speed of ship detection can be improved by analysing big data, such as by deep learning.

Nutrient retention is a very important objective for constructed wetlands, to avoid eutrophication of aquatic environments receiving their effluents. This study assessed the performance of constructed wetlands in terms of nutrient retention and associated parameters under the humid conditions of Ireland's temperate maritime climate. A review of the performance of 52 constructed wetland sites from 17 local authorities aimed to identify the best performing types of constructed wetlands and the treatment factors determining successful compliance with environmental standards. Data analysis compared effluent results from constructed wetlands with secondary free surface flow or tertiary horizontal subsurface flow, hybrid systems and integrated constructed wetlands with those from small-scale mechanical wastewater treatment plants of the same size class. Nutrient concentrations in effluents of constructed wetlands were negatively correlated (p < .01) with specific area, i.e. the ratio of surface area and population equivalents. The latest generation of integrated constructed wetlands, which had applied design guidelines issued by the Department of the Environment, performed best. Storm management design features improved treatment performance of constructed wetlands significantly (p < .05) for total suspended solids concentrations and exceedance frequency of limit values for total nitrogen. Mechanical wastewater treatment plants, secondary free surface water and tertiary horizontal subsurface flow wetlands showed a very large variance in effluent concentrations for organic and nutrient parameters. E. coli numbers in effluents were lowest for integrated constructed wetlands with an arithmetic mean of 89 MPN/100 ml. Despite Ireland's humid climate, some constructed wetland sites achieved long or frequent periods of zero effluent discharge and thus did not transfer any waterborne pollution to their receptors during these periods.","https://www.proquest.com/docview/2045828432?accountid=44943&bdid=84593&_bd=F6jBm0Hn4NEv6sg2JuCijE7d6%2Fw%3D","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jenvman.2017.12.079"

Cloud masking for ocean colour data processing is based on the assumption that the water reflectance is close to zero in the near-infrared (NIR). This is valid over the open ocean, but coastal waters may have a higher NIR reflectance due to the presence of suspended sediment concentration and non-maritime aerosols. As the result, more scattering is observed in the water leaving radiance and hence sometimes the cloud-free pixels are also classified as clouds, leading to data loss. In this present study, we have analysed cloud albedo value for masking the clouds using the default cloud masking threshold (0.027) set for processing the global ocean colour sensors like SeaWiFS and MODIS and now OCM-2 in the SeaWiFS Data Analysis System (SeaDAS). The default cloud masking value of SeaDAS over masks the clouds and sometimes the turbid coastal water pixels are also getting masked when implemented over the COM-2 imageries. Hence, an exercise has been carried out to set the cloud albedo value for OCM-2 sensor and the albedo values were tested with the lower and higher values ranging from 0.015 to 5.0 as the threshold and from the analysis it is found that 0.07 is the optimum value for Ocean Colour Monitor-2 (OCM-2) sensor for masking the clouds. Using this threshold, maximum valid ocean pixels are achieved compared to the default cloud albedo mask with the value 0.027. This has been checked with both the Local Area Coverage (LAC) and Global Area Coverage (GAC) products of OCM-2 and the results were also compared with the MODIS data. Hence, it is recommended that 0.07 is the optimum cloud masking threshold for OCM-2 sensor.","https://www.proquest.com/docview/1837333971?accountid=44943&bdid=84593&_bd=Z4Z6WFhd4kUUSmkYlbzXO%2B%2Fdxlo%3D",""

A comprehensive method to design maritime rigid structures under impact loads does not exist yet and the actual design method suggests avoiding scenarios where impact loads can take place.

The use of different sensors can lead to significant changes in the results and an ""exhaustive comparison"" between dissimilar types of sensors has not been done yet. Even the magnitude of these forces can be underestimated during a laboratory test just for the choice of sample frequencies which are too low.

The methodology employs a combination of tools including statistical analysis, compressor modelling to predict the engine airflow and energy and exergy analyses, whereas its output includes the engine operating profile, the most frequently occurring propeller curves and the engine most frequent operating points, the key performance indicators for quantitatively assessing the recorded parameters quality as well as the energy/exergy flows and the engine components exergy destruction. The methodology is implemented for three case studies for a very large crude carrier, a container ship and a bulk carrier, for which recorded data were available by using different monitoring techniques from either noon reports or automatic data acquisition systems. The derived results provide the engine operating profile demonstrating that the investigated vessels were operating in slow steaming conditions with a lower engine efficiency associated with a greater exhaust gas wasted energy. The measured data analysis demonstrates the better quality of the data recorded by automated monitoring systems and pinpoint maintenance issues of the engine components. Lastly, the exergy analysis results demonstrate that the exhaust gas and jacket cooling water provide the greater exergy flows rendering them attractive for energy saving initiatives, whereas the engine block, compressor and turbine are the engine components with the greater exergy destruction, thus requiring closer monitoring for timely identifying mitigating measures.","https://www.proquest.com/docview/2220849603?accountid=44943&bdid=84593&_bd=oMBRIqDPh0k%2BKZViXxDht44kCEw%3D","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jclepro.2018.08.154"

The first two sources were characterized by high concentrations of PAHs and metals and related to the steelworks, while the vanadium source was probably associated with maritime traffic in the port area. This preliminary monitoring approach proved effective in identifying the fugitive emission contribution of the steel plant to the surrounding air quality.","https://www.proquest.com/docview/1660068004?accountid=44943&bdid=84593&_bd=Ul4dyKHW8E4PP2c5s%2BmiWj37mXo%3D","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.atmosenv.2013.07.001"

Wave loads on rigid structures are divided into quasi static loads and impact loads. If the physics of quasi-static loads due to waves is well known, this cannot be said the same for wave impact loads. A comprehensive method to design maritime rigid structures under impact loads does not exist yet and the actual design method suggests avoiding scenarios where impact loads can take place. In the last decade, some laboratory experiments have been carried out; however some questions remain still unanswered. The use of different sensors can lead to significant changes in the results and an ""exhaustive comparison"" between dissimilar types of sensors has not been done yet. Even the magnitude of these forces can be underestimated during a laboratory test just for the choice of sample frequencies which are too low. This paper describes the experiments performed on a small scale flume at UPC on a scaled vertical breakwater in order to compare the results of pressure transducers and force load cells. Moreover, a high frequency sampler (up to 20 KHz) was used in order to understand the importance of sample frequency on the magnitude of the results.

Cloud masking for ocean colour data processing is based on the assumption that the water reflectance is close to zero in the near-infrared (NIR). This is valid over the open ocean, but coastal waters may have a higher NIR reflectance due to the presence of suspended sediment concentration and non-maritime aerosols. As the result, more scattering is observed in the water leaving radiance and hence sometimes the cloud-free pixels are also classified as clouds, leading to data loss. In this present study, we have analysed cloud albedo value for masking the clouds using the default cloud masking threshold (0.027) set for processing the global ocean colour sensors like SeaWiFS and MODIS and now OCM-2 in the SeaWiFS Data Analysis System (SeaDAS). The default cloud masking value of SeaDAS over masks the clouds and sometimes the turbid coastal water pixels are also getting masked when implemented over the COM-2 imageries. Hence, an exercise has been carried out to set the cloud albedo value for OCM-2 sensor and the albedo values were tested with the lower and higher values ranging from 0.015 to 5.0 as the threshold and from the analysis it is found that 0.07 is the optimum value for Ocean Colour Monitor-2 (OCM-2) sensor for masking the clouds. Using this threshold, maximum valid ocean pixels are achieved compared to the default cloud albedo mask with the value 0.027. This has been checked with both the Local Area Coverage (LAC) and Global Area Coverage (GAC) products of OCM-2 and the results were also compared with the MODIS data. Hence, it is recommended that 0.07 is the optimum cloud masking threshold for OCM-2 sensor.","https://www.proquest.com/docview/2000061959?accountid=44943&bdid=84593&_bd=RZMBRffJUPe3YMple4yDEZr3oyg%3D","https://doi.org/10.1007/s12524-014-0418-0"

The purpose of this study is to identify and develop a framework for risk management of cruise ship disease based on the research literature of cruise diseases in the Web of Science from 1996 to 2019. The study analyzed the characteristics of the literature researchers, the relationships between their research institutions organizations, the main cruise ship disease cases and measures. Based on the discussion of COVID-19 on cruise ships，risk management factors of cruise ship diseases were proposed，which include the port country's epidemic prevention capacity, the mode of disease transmission, the relevant regulations on international public health disposal, the design and construction of cruise ships, the medical and health conditions on cruise ships, and the characteristics of cruise tourism activities. A timeline and system framework for cruise ship disease risk management is proposed. A special ""maritime mobile community prevention and control system"" should be established, and a cooperation mechanism consisting of the government, non-governmental organizations, trade groups and industry experts should be established. The port should be capable of border isolation, detection and establishment of temporary shelter hospitals.

The industrial harbour at Kitimat (British Columbia, Canada) provides an ideal location to study the bioavailability and bioaccumulation of sediment hydrocarbons to low trophic level biota. Samples of soft shell clams (Mya arenaria) and intertidal sediment collected from multiple sites over six years at various distances from an aluminium smelter and a pulp and paper mill were analysed for 106 PAHs, plant diterpenes and other aromatic fraction hydrocarbons. Interpretation using PAH source ratios and multivariate data analysis reveals six principal hydrocarbon sources: PAHs in coke, pitch and emissions from anode combustion from the aluminium smelter, vascular plant terpenes and aromatised terpenes from the pulp and paper mill, petroleum PAHs from shipping and other anthropogenic activities and PAHs from natural plant detritus. Harbour sediments predominantly contain either pitch or pyrogenic PAHs from the smelter, while clams predominantly contain plant derived PAHs and diterpenes from the adjacent pulp mill. PAHs from the smelter have low bioavailability to clams (Biota-Sediment Accumulation Factors; BSAFs <1 for pitch and coke; <10 for anode combustion, decreasing to ∼0.1 for the mass 300 and 302 PAHs), possibly due to binding to pitch or soot carbon matrices. Decreases in PAH isomer ratios between sediments and clams likely reflect a combination of variation in uptake kinetics of petroleum PAHs and compound specific metabolism, with the importance of petroleum PAHs decreasing with increasing molecular weight. Plant derived compounds exhibit little natural bioaccumulation at reference sites, but unsaturated and aromatised diterpenes released from resins by industrial pulping processes are readily accumulated by the clams (BSAFs >500). Thus while most of the smelter associated PAHs in sediments may not be bioavailable to benthic organisms, the plant terpenes (including retene, totarol, ferruginol, manool, dehydroabietane and other plant terpenes that form the chemical defence mechanism of conifers) released by pulp mills are bioavailable and possess demonstrated toxic properties. The large scale release of plant terpenes by some of the many pulp mills located in British Columbia and elsewhere represents a largely undocumented risk to aquatic biota.","https://www.proquest.com/docview/1431616113?accountid=44943&bdid=84593&_bd=sYFsnmltN6%2FMd%2B9mDJ3TjNB9Pls%3D","https://doi.org/21788067"

A reduction of TC genesis (Group 1) is coincident with a warming in the Indian Ocean and a positive tripolar SST pattern in the North Atlantic, while enhanced TC genesis (Group 2) corresponds to the configuration without significant SST anomalies in the North Atlantic and in the Indian Ocean. Relevant physical mechanisms are investigated through observational data analysis and confirmed with model simulations. In Group 1, El Niño SST anomalies enhance convection over the central‐eastern equatorial Pacific. The related latent heat release excites Rossby wave trains which can efficiently propagate energy from the eastern tropical Pacific into Central America and further into the subtropical North Atlantic. The warm SST anomalies found in the Indian Ocean and in the North Atlantic can force robust anomalous easterlies in the tropical WNP, producing unfavourable dynamic and thermodynamic conditions for TC genesis. Group 2 shows a quite distinct situation. Actually, the late winter anomalous westerlies are much weaker over Central America in Group 2, providing a configuration of inhibition for an efficient wave energy propagation from the tropics into the subtropical North Atlantic. The warm SST over the Maritime Continent is then responsible for the increase of TC genesis over the South China Sea and around the Philippines by exciting a cyclonic circulation in the TC active season.","https://www.proquest.com/docview/2536514514?accountid=44943&bdid=84593&_bd=eY6HAZRSGR7LVGX8LKoYbthvWy4%3D","https://doi.org/10.1002/qj.4042"

This study aimed to develop a robust clinical pharmacodynamic (PD) assay to measure the on-target PD effects of the selective PI3K inhibitor GDC-0941 in MM patients. Methods: We conducted an in vitro drug wash-out study to evaluate the feasibility of biochemical approaches in measuring the phosphorylation of S6 ribosomal protein (S6), one of the commonly used PD markers for PI3K pathway inhibition. We then developed a 7-color phospho-specific flow cytometry assay, or phospho flow assay, to measure the phosphorylation state of intracellular S6 in bone marrow aspirate (BMA) and peripheral blood (PB). Integrated mean fluorescence intensity (iMFI) was used to calculate fold changes of phosphorylation. Assay sensitivity was evaluated by comparing phospho flow with Meso Scale Discovery (MSD) and immunohistochemistry (IHC) assays. Finally, a sample handling method was developed to maintain the integrity of phospho signal during sample shipping and storage to ensure clinical application. Results: The phospho flow assay provided single-cell PD monitoring of S6 phosphorylation in tumor and surrogate cells using fixed BMA and PB, assessing pathway modulation in response to GDC-0941 with sensitivity similar to that of MSD assay. The one-shot sample fixation and handling protocol herein demonstrated exceptional preservation of protein phosphorylation. In contrast, the IHC assay was less sensitive in terms of signal quantification while the biochemical approach (MSD) was less suitable to assess PD activities due to the undesirable impact associated with cell isolation on the protein phosphorylation in tumor cells. Conclusions: We developed a robust PD biomarker assay for the clinical evaluation of PI3K inhibitors in MM, allowing one to decipher the PD response in a relevant cell population. To our knowledge, this is the first report of an easily implemented clinical PD assay that incorporates an unbiased one-shot sample handling protocol, all (staining)-in-one (tube) phospho flow staining protocol, and an integrated modified data analysis for PD monitoring of kinase inhibitors in relevant cell populations in BMA and PB. The methods described here ensure a real-time, reliable and reproducible PD readout, which can provide information for dose selection as well as help to identify optimal combinations of targeted agents in early clinical trials.","https://www.proquest.com/docview/1367484481?accountid=44943&bdid=84593&_bd=jl5DsWCbbUxvT6iFeATu7ZuNDdk%3D","https://doi.org/10.1186/1479-5876-11-76"

The species-abundance frequency distribution (pattern of species abundance) was a good fit to the log series model and this model was used for subsequent data analysis. No single-night sample adequately estimated the log series alpha index of diversity based on the total catch; some sampling effort was required each night. Each night's catch was separated into 16, 30-minute samples. The alpha index of diversity for the summed catch for each time-period was compared with the overall alpha based on the total catch. A strategy that involved operating the trap for just a 1-hour period each night had no effect on the pattern of species abundance and gave a value for alpha equal to that obtained by operating the trap for an 8-hour period each night. This strategy reduced the catch from 6088 to 971 moths and the number of species from 255 to 161. Processing costs associated with the larger sample and any possible negative effect on the moth population caused by removal trapping were greatly reduced.

This disorder is of commercial importance since shipping of peaches to distant markets and storage before selling require low temperature. However, knowledge about the molecular basis of peach woolliness is still incomplete. To address this issue, a nylon macroarray containing 847 non-redundant expressed sequence tags (ESTs) from a ripe peach fruit cDNA library was developed and used. Gene expression changes of peach fruit (Prunus persica cv.

A total of 106 genes were found to be differentially expressed between juicy and woolly fruit. Data analysis indicated that the activity of most of these genes (>90%) was repressed in the woolly fruit. In cold-stored peaches (cv.

This separation is due to the extensive management of the RRD (e.g., dykes and dams) for the purposes of irrigation and inundation prevention. Mainstream river section δ¹⁸O and δ²H compositions range from −10.58 and −73.74‰ to −6.80 and −43.40‰, respectively, and the corresponding ranges inside the RRD were from −9.35 and −64.27‰ to −2.09 and −15.80‰. A combination of data analysis and hydrological simulation confirms the role of upstream hydropower reservoirs in retaining and mixing upstream water. River water inside the RRD experienced strong evaporation characterized by depleted d‐excess values, becoming negative in summer. On the other hand, the main stream of the Red River has d‐excess values around 10‰, indicating moderate evaporation. Hydrograph separation shows that in upstream subbasins, the groundwater fraction dominates the river flow composition, especially during low flow regimes. Inside the RRD, the river receives groundwater during the dry season, whereas groundwater replenishment occurs in the rainy season. Annual evaporation obtained from this hydrograph separation computation was about 6.3% of catchment discharge, the same order as deduced from the difference between subbasin precipitation and discharge values. This study shows the necessity to re‐evaluate empirical approaches in large river hydrology assessment schemes, especially in the context of climate change.","https://www.proquest.com/docview/2000581762?accountid=44943&bdid=84593&_bd=6H9KxkyUOkbgBw4CG97jZyfDDp0%3D","https://doi.org/10.1002/hyp.11296"

Analysis of the GPCC precipitation shows a dipolar structure of wet southwest versus dry central and northeast in precipitation anomalies associated with El Nino over Borneo Island during the austral summer [December-February (DJF)]. By using the 0.25 degree and 3-hourly CMORPH precipitation, it is found that rainfall over Borneo is strongly affected by the diurnal cycle of land-sea breezes. The spatial distribution of rainfall over Borneo depends on the direction of monsoonal winds. Weather typing analysis indicates that the dipolar structure of rainfall anomalies associated with ENSO is caused by the variability in the frequency of occurrence of different weather types. Rainfall is enhanced in the coastal region where sea breezes head against off-shore synoptic-scale low-level winds (i.e., in the lee side or wake area of the island), which is referred to here as the ""wake effect."" In DJF of El Nino years, the northwesterly austral summer monsoon in southern Borneo is weaker than normal over the Maritime Continent and easterly winds are more frequent than normal over Borneo, acting to enhance rainfall over the southwest coast of the island. This coastal rainfall generation mechanism in different weather types explains the dipole pattern of a wet southwest versus dry northeast in the rainfall anomalies over Borneo Island in the El Nino years.","https://www.proquest.com/docview/1318692933?accountid=44943&bdid=84593&_bd=vEalXR8gWNXqMzXAJsQJJk7gHiM%3D","https://doi.org/10.1175/JCLI-D-12-00178.1"

This disorder is of commercial importance since shipping of peaches to distant markets and storage before selling require low temperature. However, knowledge about the molecular basis of peach woolliness is still incomplete. To address this issue, a nylon macroarray containing 847 non-redundant expressed sequence tags (ESTs) from a ripe peach fruit cDNA library was developed and used. Gene expression changes of peach fruit (Prunus persica cv. O'Henry) ripened for 7 d at 21 °C (juicy fruit) were compared with those of fruit stored for 15 d at 4 °C and then ripened for 7 d at 21 °C (woolly fruit). A total of 106 genes were found to be differentially expressed between juicy and woolly fruit. Data analysis indicated that the activity of most of these genes (>90%) was repressed in the woolly fruit. In cold-stored peaches (cv. O'Henry), the expression level of selected genes (cobra, endopolygalacturonase, cinnamoyl-CoA-reductase, and rab11) was lower than in the juicy fruit, and it remained low in woolly peaches after ripening, a pattern that was conserved in woolly fruit from two other commercial cultivars (cv. Flamekist and cv. Elegant Lady). In addition, the results of this study indicate that molecular changes during fruit woolliness involve changes in the expression of genes associated with cell wall metabolism and endomembrane trafficking. Overall, the results reported here provide an initial characterization of the transcriptome activity of peach fruit under different post-harvest treatments.","https://www.proquest.com/docview/47670529?accountid=44943&bdid=84593&_bd=v8pyyWepvu2wFLOAsFHQkjhgjdg%3D","https://doi.org/18453640"

As a consequence, there are numerous ISA education models and curricula in existence at educational institutions around the world. Organizations employing ISA professionals generally base their assessment of an individual's skill level based on academic qualifications or certifications. While academic qualifications support broad knowledge and skills in general, professional certifications may be effective in a limited area of operations. Academic programs exposing the students to theoretical concepts and problem solving experience are critical for preparing graduates for jobs in the information security. The critical importance of information security curriculum at universities is stressed. Therefore, it is appropriate to evaluate the quality of academic information security programs and suggest changes or improvements in the curricula to ensure that undergraduates and graduates have gained the required skills after completing their studies. Despite a variety of ISA curricula and diverse educational models, universities often fail to provide their graduates with skills demanded by employers. There is a big discrepancy between the levels of skills expected by employers and those the graduates have after completing their studies. In U.S., many educational institutions defined the educational model and curricula based on standards and guidelines promoted by government or other organizations, resulting in numerous ISA education models and curricula. However, the focus is on practical, low level skills which are identified in various standards. Issues related to Information Security curricula include content, didactic methodology, and degrees in Information Security. In addition, ABET accreditation criteria of 2005-2006 for US computing programs (computer engineering, computer science, information systems) still do not include criteria for evaluating information security education. Information security education in other countries is briefly compared with the ISA educational programs in the U.S. We identified that there is greater variation and flexibility in the ISA academic programs with universities located outside the U.S. Many universities offer sound curricula to focus on specific skills required for information security systems developers and information security managers. In nearly all countries, the ISA related research is sponsored by universities and 'National Laboratories'that can be viewed as counterparts of NIST and NSF. We briefly discuss changes to approaches, topics, resources, and courses. We discuss the implementation of an effective ISA curriculum based on the curriculum content, methodology, currency, and research. It is necessary to recognize that the curriculum content of an ISA program is multidisciplinary, with inter-related topics coming from computer science, computer engineering, mathematics, management, information systems, business, political science, psychology, sociology, and law. Specific topics should be included about securing critical infrastructure that covers all sectors (agriculture, food, water, public health, emergency services, government, defense, information and telecommunications, energy, transportation, banking and finance, chemical industries and hazardous materials, postal and shipping, monuments and icons). As organizations build knowledge from a strategic, managerial, and operational perspective, universities and training organizations should teach skills that are mapping to these areas. Scholarly research should explore new technologies and new approaches to obtain more effective and long-term solutions. The timely dissemination and sharing of the results produced by ISA researchers in academic institutions is very desirable. ISA curriculum should cover courses and experiments involving Intelligent Systems and Artificial Intelligence techniques that support intelligent control of security and create the knowledge base for information security domain. Also, there is a need to incorporate ISA topics throughout undergraduate curricula for all computing disciplines. The selection of courses for an ISA program should be based on strategic knowledge because functions and knowledge areas that are of strategic importance, and critical to business of the enterprise, are less likely to be outsourced. Finally, we suggest actions that should make the ISA curricula in the universities responsive to the needs of the general population and the industry in which graduates with ISA skills and specialization will be employed.","https://www.proquest.com/docview/787063685?accountid=44943&bdid=84593&_bd=trEhDrU4nuFf5uOB34zpcRDZD2A%3D",""

Pointwise uncertainty values are needed for modeling and data analysis and should include all the random errors affecting each data point. Total uncertainty can be decomposed into two primary components: analytical measurement uncertainty and sampling uncertainty. Analytical measurement uncertainties are relatively easy to calculate from routine quality control (QC) data. Sampling uncertainties, on the other hand, are comparatively difficult to measure. In this paper, the authors describe data from collocated samplers to provide a snapshot of whole-system uncertainty for several important chemical species. The components of uncertainty were evaluated for key species from each of the analytical methods employed by the PM2.5 Speciation Trends Network (STN) program: gravimetry, ion chromatography (IC), X-ray fluorescence (XRF), and thermal-optical analysis for organic carbon and elemental carbon. The results show that the laboratory measurement uncertainties are typically very small compared with uncertainties calculated from the differences between samples collected from collocated samplers. These differences are attributable to the ""field"" components uncertainty, which may include contamination and/or losses during shipping, handling, and sampling, as well as other distortions of the concentration level due to flow and sample volume variations. Uncertainties calculated from the collocation results were found to be generally similar to the uncertainties currently being loaded into EPA's AQS system, with some exceptions described below.","https://www.proquest.com/docview/67949195?accountid=44943&bdid=84593&_bd=Ynbb7JyTCAg%2BOZVddMnp0auXJPw%3D",""

A spectrophotometer, with a wavelength range of 200-2500nm, was used to measure the spectral reflectance data of peels from market quality fruit and fruits that were infected with cake melanose, wind scar, copper burn, greasy spot and canker. Statistical data analysis was performed on the spectral reflectance data to identify the wavelengths that had maximum discriminatory potential among the different peel conditions and to derive a discriminant function from the identified wavelengths. The discriminatory wavelengths were identified in the visible and the visible near infrared range. In addition, the classification based on the derived discriminant function resulted in 100% classification of canker.

Analysis of the HALOE and CDC data demonstrates that cirrus extinction is larger over deep convection than over clearer regions by a factor of 3. Deep convection, however, occupies only 7% of the equatorial region. Ninety percent of the cirrus clouds near the tropopause are located outside of regions of deep convection. Estimates of the equivalent H sub(2)O amount in the cirrus are calculated by applying transformations from extinction to volume density. Averaged over the HALOE 2 km vertical field of view, the amount of equivalent H sub(2)O in cirrus is 0.1-0.2 ppmv, which is 2 to 5% of the local gas phase H sub(2)O.

This work, sponsored by the U.S. Coast Guard, includes the testing of eight composite materials and one textile wall covering in several standard test methods. Materials were tested in the ISO 9705 room corner test, the cone calorimeter, the International Maritime Organization's surface flammability test apparatus, the smoke chamber, and in real-scale configurations as furniture items and overhead luggage racks. Summary data from these tests are presented, with particular emphasis on correlations between the room corner test and the cone calorimeter. Data from this research programme were used to develop cone calorimeter acceptance criteria for materials used in furniture and other room contents in high-speed craft. Future work will include more data analysis and fire growth modelling in order to further develop acceptance criteria for other materials, especially compartment linings. This programme has served as an example of how well-planned and coordinated research can be effective tool in the evaluation of existing regulations and the development of new safety standards, helping to ensure public safety through technically justified standards.","https://www.proquest.com/docview/17526407?accountid=44943&bdid=84593&_bd=SiGB7KDNHwxWLCVvjgN0BQSeZLo%3D","https://doi.org/10.1002/(SICI)1099-1018(200001/02)24:1<29::AID-FAM695>3.3.CO;2-G"

The industrial harbour at Kitimat (British Columbia, Canada) provides an ideal location to study the bioavailability and bioaccumulation of sediment hydrocarbons to low trophic level biota. Samples of soft shell clams (Mya arenaria) and intertidal sediment collected from multiple sites over six years at various distances from an aluminium smelter and a pulp and paper mill were analysed for 106 PAHs, plant diterpenes and other aromatic fraction hydrocarbons. Interpretation using PAH source ratios and multivariate data analysis reveals six principal hydrocarbon sources: PAHs in coke, pitch and emissions from anode combustion from the aluminium smelter, vascular plant terpenes and aromatised terpenes from the pulp and paper mill, petroleum PAHs from shipping and other anthropogenic activities and PAHs from natural plant detritus. Harbour sediments predominantly contain either pitch or pyrogenic PAHs from the smelter, while clams predominantly contain plant derived PAHs and diterpenes from the adjacent pulp mill. PAHs from the smelter have low bioavailability to clams (Biota-Sediment Accumulation Factors; BSAFs <1 for pitch and coke; <10 for anode combustion, decreasing to -0.1 for the mass 300 and 302 PAHs), possibly due to binding to pitch or soot carbon matrices. Decreases in PAH isomer ratios between sediments and clams likely reflect a combination of variation in uptake kinetics of petroleum PAHs and compound specific metabolism, with the importance of petroleum PAHs decreasing with increasing molecular weight. Plant derived compounds exhibit little natural bioaccumulation at reference sites, but unsaturated and aromatised diterpenes released from resins by industrial pulping processes are readily accumulated by the clams (BSAFs >500). Thus while most of the smelter associated PAHs in sediments may not be bioavailable to benthic organisms, the plant terpenes (including retene, totarol, ferruginol, manool, dehydroabietane and other plant terpenes that form the chemical defence mechanism of conifers) released by pulp mills are bioavailable and possess demonstrated toxic properties. The large scale release of plant terpenes by some of the many pulp mills located in British Columbia and elsewhere represents a largely undocumented risk to aquatic biota.","https://www.proquest.com/docview/899150314?accountid=44943&bdid=84593&_bd=7vV5pV%2FReGMqyqzfGe6clC0Vd4Q%3D","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.marenvres.2011.06.004"

Container contents were compared against the container label, and the label record was compared against the original prescription order. The overall dispensing error rate was 0.075% (16 dispensing errors among 21,252 prescriptions, 95% confidence interval 0.043-0.122). Fourteen errors involved incomplete or incorrect directions on the final label. All dispensing errors were associated with the initial stages of prescription processing (including order entry); no errors were associated with the mechanical stages of product dispensing.CONCLUSIONA highly automated mail-service pharmacy can achieve a dispensing error rate of less than 1 error/1000 prescriptions, which is substantially lower than the rates reported for retail pharmacies. A high degree of automation in the mechanical aspects of dispensing appears to be a key factor in achieving this high dispensing accuracy.","https://www.proquest.com/docview/68702580?accountid=44943&bdid=84593&_bd=O2rBFPRJ4C15zcC%2B%2FSHYq0Pn%2F3A%3D",""

One hundred ten glass fragments dating to the third to sixth centuries CE from a secondary deposit at the Yasmina Necropolis in Carthage have been analysed by electron microprobe analysis (EPMA) to characterise the supply of glass to the city. Detailed bivariate and multivariate data analysis identified different primary glass groups and revealed evidence of extensive recycling. Roman mixed antimony and manganese glasses with MnO contents in excess of 250 ppm were clearly the product of recycling, while iron, potassium and phosphorus oxides were frequent contaminants. Primary glass sources were discriminated using TiO2 as a proxy for heavy minerals (ilmenite/spinel), Al2O3 for feldspar and SiO2 for quartz in the glassmaking sands. It was thus possible to draw conclusions about the chronological and geographical attributions of the primary glass types. Throughout much of the period covered in this study, glassworkers in Carthage utilised glass from both Egyptian and Levantine sources. Based on their geochemical characteristics, we conclude that Roman antimony and Roman manganese glasses originated from Egypt and the Levant, respectively, and were more or less simultaneously worked at Carthage in the fourth century as attested by their mixed recycling (Roman Sb-Mn). In the later fourth and early fifth centuries, glasses from Egypt (HIMT) and the Levant (two Levantine I groups) continued to be imported to Carthage, although the Egyptian HIMT is less well represented at Yasmina than in many other late antique glass assemblages. In contrast, in the later fifth and sixth centuries, glass seems to have been almost exclusively sourced from Egypt in the form of a manganese-decolourised glass originally described and characterised by Foy and colleagues (2003). Hence, the Yasmina assemblage testifies to significant fluctuations in the supply of glass to Carthage that require further attention.","https://www.proquest.com/docview/1929825940?accountid=44943&bdid=84593&_bd=rG5k6GHZGKZCpnvsGfRj5yk41Ac%3D","https://doi.org/10.1007/s12520-016-0316-1"

The program was designed to complement routine health and social care services. It relied on a special telephone service and outreach consultations located in the town halls of the five most affected cities. The objective of this outreach service was to provide initial psychological counseling free of charge and without appointment. Another objective was to refer persons for appropriate treatment and follow-up by routine health care services. A surveillance program was developed to monitor the use of mental health services by first-time users, describe outreach service users with psychological manifestations, and provide timely information to decision makers.METHODSHealth providers working in affected towns were asked to complete an individual record sheet for each person who displayed psychological manifestations directly or indirectly linked with the storm on their first visit, and to send it to the regional health office. Participation was voluntary. Data analysis was performed monthly during the six-month surveillance period.RESULTSOnly mental health providers participated in the surveillance. A total of 227 individual files were sent from April 7 through September 19, 2010. New cases were mainly female adults, and one fifth had a past history of psychiatric illness. Depressive signs and anxiety were the most commonly reported symptoms, followed by signs of post-traumatic stress disorder. A total of five feedback reports were produced for surveillance participants (informants) and authorities.CONCLUSIONWith initiation in the post-emergency phase of a disaster and timely regular feedback, the surveillance program enabled the authors to describe the occurrence of psychological distress, monitor mental health service use by first-time users, and provide guidance to health authorities. This research showed the advantages of integrating epidemiology in the development of strategy for mental health and psychosocial support in the aftermath of natural catastrophes.","https://www.proquest.com/docview/1082408942?accountid=44943&bdid=84593&_bd=aLEOp%2BzSivhIP0yeuC4%2Bil%2FGJ8A%3D","https://doi.org/10.1017/S1049023X12001082"

In the analysis of lidar signals, the two-component lidar equation was solved under the assumption of similarity in the derived profiles of backscatter coefficients for each wavelength, and this made it possible to reduce the uncertainty in the extinction/backscatter ratio, which is a key parameter in the lidar solution. It is shown that a three-wavelength lidar system operating at 300, 600, and 1064 nm can provide unique information for discriminating between various aerosol types such as continental, maritime, Saharan dust, stratospheric aerosols in a tropopause fold event, and tropical forest aerosols. Measurement error estimation was also made through numerical simulations. Mie calculations were made using in situ aerosol data and aerosol models to compare with the lidar results. There was disagreement between the theoretical and empirical results, which in some cases was substantial. These differences may be partly due to uncertainties in the lidar data analysis and aerosol characteristics and also due to the conventional assumption of aerosol sphericity for the aerosol Mie calculations.","https://www.proquest.com/docview/733338415?accountid=44943&bdid=84593&_bd=n%2BiHMXAgY65%2BHUv5iZIWqvgVGqA%3D","https://doi.org/10.1364/AO.28.001670"

This is one of the first evaluations conducted to document the outcomes of the Army Nurse Corps (ANC) transition-to practice residency program.Materials and MethodsThis project was a prospective pre-test/post-test design evaluation of newly licensed registered nurses (RNs) entering the military health system from Fall 2017 to Fall 2018 using Casey-Fink Readiness for Practice Survey and the New Graduate RN Transition Program Competency Assessment Tool. Data were analyzed using SAS 9.4. All tests were two-tailed as applicable and p-values less than 0.05 were considered significant. Missing data were treated as missing for individual items; their values were not imputed. No participant was excluded due to missing items. This evaluation was determined to be exempt from human subject protection regulations by the Human Protections Administrator at Womack Army Medical Center.ResultsA total of 92 pre-test surveys were sent to the nine CNTP training sites which actively trained RNs during the study timeframe. Due to a shipping error, 6 of the 92 completed pre-test surveys from one CNTP site were not received, for an overall response rate of 93.4% (86/92), from eight CNTP sites. Of the 86 participants from whom pre-tests were received, all 86 successfully returned their post-test survey, for a 100% response rate pre- to post- survey. The participants were predominately white (73.3%) and female (70.9%) with a median age of 23 years (IQR: 22–24 years) and an undergraduate GPA of 3.5 (IQR: 3.4–3.7, Table II). Quantitative data analysis revealed that after the training, all participants reported a significant improvement in providing safe (p< 0.0001) and quality care (p< 0.0001) for an average workload of in-patient patients. It also showed a significant improvement in team leading (p< 0.0001), effective decision making (p< 0.0001), incorporating evidence into practice (p< 0.0001), and demonstrated professionalism (p< 0.0001). The overall clinical competence and readiness to practice (p< 0.0001) also improved. Data shows that participants perceive significant improvement in all the objectives set by the ANC for the transition program.ConclusionThe results of this program evaluation provide evidence that the CNTP has been a success in meeting the intended objectives. Participants showed a significant improvement in their perceived readiness and level of competency in clinical, technical, and leadership skills performance at the end of the program, as well as improved communication and teamwork. The CNTP experience provides an effective means to facilitate the development of newly licensed Army nurses’ clinical competence and confidence in practice. The study limitation includes the Casey-Fink Readiness for Practice Survey had relatively low reliability, but it was chosen as it was better aligned to the specified CNTP objectives. And also, with any self-reported evaluation, there is potential bias regarding the accuracy of participants’ self-perception. Follow-up study may include examining the demographics of the incoming nurses, such as their source of commission. To determine if and how the comfort and confidence self-reported by the new graduate nurses is reflective of actual ability, nurse preceptors may be asked to complete skills assessments or simulations with objective measurements may be used.","https://www.proquest.com/docview/2430100906?accountid=44943&bdid=84593&_bd=TWOvY390gcZrDoQnZj670vjP7jw%3D","https://doi.org/10.1093/milmed/usz108"

Law enforcement and/or public safety and health officials often have the responsibility for identifying the human remains found at the scene, so they can be returned to their families. The recovered human remains range from being relatively intact to highly degraded. DNA-based identity testing is a powerful tool for victim identification in that the data are not restricted to any particular one to one body landmark comparison and DNA profile comparisons can be used to associate separated remains or body parts. Even though DNA typing is straightforward, a disaster is a chaotic environment that can complicate effective identification of the remains. With some planning, or at least identification of the salient features to consider, stress can be reduced for those involved in the identification process. General guidelines are provided for developing an action plan for identification of human remains from a mass disaster by DNA analysis. These include: (1) sample collection, preservation, shipping and storage; (2) tracking and chain of custody issues; (3) laboratory facilities; (4) quality assurance and quality control practices; (5) parsing out work; (6) extraction and typing; (7) interpretation of results; (8) automation; (9) software for tracking and managing data; (10) the use of an advisory panel; (11) education and communication; and (12) privacy issues. In addition, key technologies that may facilitate the identification process are discussed, such as resin based DNA extraction, real-time PCR for quantitation of DNA, use of mini-STRs, SNP detection procedures, and software. Many of the features necessary for DNA typing of human remains from a mass disaster are the same as those for missing persons' cases. Therefore, developing a missing persons DNA identification program would also provide the basis for a mass disaster human remains DNA identification program.","https://www.proquest.com/docview/67967053?accountid=44943&bdid=84593&_bd=qySjifJdEqSLXbUDWMkzmXuFOA8%3D",""

Technological advances have enabled affordable, high-quality digital clinical photography. In addition, this technology has enabled doctors to easily compose and present multimedia lectures with programs such as Microsoft PowerPoint. Since most practitioners already possess large numbers of conventional slides and photographs, digitization is required to convert these to a usable format. Depending on the type of image and resolution, it can take anywhere from 30 seconds to several minutes to scan each slide. This drawback delays or prevents many practitioners from switching to digital technology.OBJECTIVEUsing a digital camera and the XP version of Windows, some common tasks associated with digital images and PowerPoint presentations may be simplified and facilitated.METHODSUsing common digital cameras and computer image editing software, slides, photographs, radiographs, and textbook images may be digitized in seconds with adequate quality for most common clinical and educational applications. In addition, the use of new dual monitor functionality is discussed. This new technology comes standard with Windows XP and allows the use of two monitors simultaneously, allowing the user to view thumbnail images on one monitor and the PowerPoint presentation on the other monitor. Images may be dragged and dropped into the presentation, thereby avoiding repetitive menu commands.RESULTSThe author shows several techniques and shortcuts to assist the clinical practitioner in digitizing slides and facilitating the management of these images in PowerPoint presentations.CONCLUSIONA digital camera can be used to adequately digitize most slide pictures, and these images can be managed in a more simple and direct manner utilizing the Windows XP operating system that is shipping with most new computers.","https://www.proquest.com/docview/72654889?accountid=44943&bdid=84593&_bd=LjerQVxx36HJuCiskbp64LSF7Mc%3D",""
