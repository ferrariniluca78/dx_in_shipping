		The shipping industry is undergoing a profound digital transformation, driven by advancements in automation, artificial intelligence, blockchain, and the Internet of Things (IoT). These technologies enhance operational efficiency, optimize supply chain management, and improve sustainability by reducing emissions and fuel consumption. However, navigating this digital revolution requires a structured understanding of emerging trends, challenges, and opportunities.
		A network-based systematic review serves as a crucial methodological approach for researchers, enabling them to synthesize existing knowledge, identify research gaps, and develop informed strategies to leverage digital transformation effectively.
		By critically analyzing co-citation and co-authorship networks, modeling topics over time, and performing trend analysis, we gain insights on the current status of digital transformation within the shipping industry, ultimately guiding industry stakeholders and researchers ....XXXXXXXXXXXXXx
