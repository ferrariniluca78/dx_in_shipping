The involvement of different maritime parties in the marine transportation flow scheduling and management further escalates these challenges. Thus, we need an IoT-based collaborative processing system that unifies the modular structure and integrates multiple modules involved in MTS. Moreover, the need for a shared and controlled access mechanism that cannot be manipulated or tampered by unauthorized parties is also essential requirement in MTS. Blockchain, as an emerging technology, has become a key tool in data security protection because of its non-tampering and non-forgery characteristics. Keeping in view of this aspect, in this paper, an IoT-based collaborative processing system based on blockchain is proposed for marine transportation flow scheduling and management. In addition, we propose a novel consensus mechanism based on Verifiable Random Function (VRF) and reputation voting to reduce the communication cost in blockchain consensus communication process. The proposed scheme has been validated in a simulated environment and the results illustrate that the scheme has obvious effect in resisting replay attack and camouflage attack. Furthermore, the optimized consensus mechanism improves the security by 8% and the transaction processing speed by 6% on the premise that the communication cost is basically unchanged.","1558-0016","","10.1109/TITS.2022.3159485","Shandong Provincial Natural Science Foundation, China(grant numbers:ZR2020MF006); Industry-University Research Innovation Foundation of Ministry of Education of China(grant numbers:2021FNA01001); Major Scientific and Technological Projects of CNPC(grant numbers:ZD2019-183-006); Open Foundation of State Key Laboratory of Integrated Services Networks (Xidian University)(grant numbers:ISN23-09); Startup Fund provided by the Durham University, U.K.; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9745459","Maritime transportation systems;Internet of Things;blockchain;authentication mechanism","Blockchains;Authentication;Industries;Information security;Monitoring;Safety;Internet of Things","","34","","41","IEEE","30 Mar 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

However, due to its complexity, the maritime industry suffers from a lack of trust, lack of ownership evidence, protracted documentation procedures, and excessive data aggregation.

It permits on-chain interactions to achieve trustworthy properties such as traceability, transparency, and accountability. However, current blockchain trustworthiness is only confined to on-chain, creating a “trust gap” to the physical, off-chain environment. This is due to the lack of a scheme that can truthfully reflect the physical world in a real-time and consistent manner. Such an absence hinders further blockchain applications in the physical world, especially for the security-sensitive ones. In this paper, we propose a framework to extend blockchain trust from on-chain to off-chain, and take trustworthy vaccine tracing as an example scheme. Our scheme consists of 1) a Trusted Execution Environment (TEE)-enabled trusted environment monitoring system built with the Arm Cortex-M33 microcontroller that continuously senses the inside of a vaccine box through trusted sensors and generates anti-forgery data; and 2) a consistency protocol to upload the environment status data from the TEE system to blockchain in a truthful, real-time consistent, continuous and fault-tolerant fashion. Our security analysis indicates that no adversary can tamper with the vaccine in any way without being captured. We carry out an experiment to record the internal status of a vaccine shipping box during transportation, and the results indicate that the proposed system incurs an average latency of 84 ms in local sensing and processing followed by an average latency of 130 ms to have the sensed data transmitted to and been available in the blockchain.","1557-9956","","10.1109/TC.2022.3148379","National Key R&D Program of China(grant numbers:2019YFB2102600); National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:U1811463,61971014,61832012,61771289,11675199); National Science Foundation(grant numbers:IIS-1741279,CNS-1704397); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9705115","Blockchain;trusted execution environment;physical traceability;vaccine tracing","Blockchains;Vaccines;Monitoring;Real-time systems;Sensors;Protocols;Fault tolerant systems","","21","","25","IEEE","4 Feb 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In this paper, a lightweight blockchain called LBlockchainE is designed for edge IoT-enabled MTS to guarantee the security of sensor data stored in an edge computing environment. To save the resources of edge servers on ship, a data placement strategy is proposed. To encourage edge servers to positively contribute to storing data generated by sensor devices, storage resource consumption is employed as an influencing parameter, and servers with abundant resources are selected for priority storage. The data placement strategy also takes care of the access delay between servers and selects the nodes with the least access and storage costs as the priority storage choice. LBlockchainE applies the low-energy-consumption characteristics of Proof of Stake to determine the ownership of bookkeeping rights through a small number of competitive calculations and the resources of the node. Experimental results indicate that compared with Ethereum, the consensus mechanism of LBlockchainE consumes less energy and occupies less storage space. On average, the new system uses 1.6% less time and consumes 78% less battery power compared with traditional blockchain systems. In comparison to the random storage, the best storage, and the optimal data storage strategies, the proposed strategy maintains the same message costs.","1558-0016","","10.1109/TITS.2022.3157447","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:62072255); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9736333","Edge IoT-enabled MTS;blockchain;edge computing;LBlockchainE;security","Blockchains;Security;Servers;Internet of Things;Privacy;Marine vehicles;Costs","","15","","54","IEEE","16 Mar 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Current proof of delivery (PoD) systems lacks transparency, traceability, and credibility. These systems are mostly centralized and rely on trusted third parties (TTPs) to complete the delivery between sellers and buyers. TTPs can be costly, a single point of failure, and subject to hacking, privacy evasion, and compromise. The blockchain is an immutable, trusted, and decentralized ledger with logs and events that can be used for transparency, traceability, and tracking. In this paper, we present a solution and a general framework using the popular permissionless Ethereum blockchain to create a trusted, decentralized PoD system that ensures accountability, auditability, and integrity. The solution uses Ethereum smart contracts to prove the delivery of a shipped item between a seller and a buyer irrespective of the number of intermediate transporters needed. In our proposed solution, all participating entities are incentivized to act honestly by using a double deposit collateral. Automated payment in ether is an integral part of a solution to ensure that every entity gets its intended share of ether upon successful delivery. An arbitration mechanism is also incorporated if a dispute arises during the shipping process. In this paper, we show how we implemented, verified, and tested the proper functionality of our PoD solution.

The purpose of this study is to propose an IoT-driven state-of-the-art system for solid waste management for developing countries and urban areas. The lack of planning and availability of resources in urban areas have made a living in densely populated surroundings even more difficult. This research work provides a framework based on blockchain-enabled vehicular ad-hoc networks (VANETs) in the realm of IoT. The step-by-step methods are proposed for the decentralized solution for solid waste management using blockchain-enabled VANET. Advanced ultra-high frequency (UHF) technology is used along with IoT devices for the real-time location of waste vehicles and the detection of waste bins. Geo-fencing techniques are also applied for the monitoring and timely collection of waste from the dump spots. Lastly, blockchain technology is applied in the proposed solution to make machine-to-machine (M2M) communication more secure, reliable and trustworthy across IoT devices. The experimental results are also obtained by deploying a pilot project in Karachi, Pakistan. The real-time dashboard is also obtained to demonstrate the daily statistics of the waste collection and performance of the waste vehicles. The results indicate the successful implementation of SSWMS to achieve real-time tracking, intelligent identification of waste bins, trash weighing, and keeping tabs on waste collection from dump spots using geofencing.

However, the open communication channels among various entities, including smart vehicles, roadside infrastructure, and fleet management systems, introduce security and privacy vulnerabilities. To address these concerns, we propose a novel security framework, named blockchain-assisted lightweight authenticated key agreement security framework for smart vehicles-enabled ITS (BASF-ITS), which ensures data protection both during transit and while stored on cloud servers. BASF-ITS employs a combination of efficient cryptographic primitives, including hash functions, XOR operator, ASCON, elliptic curve cryptography, and physical unclonable functions (PUF), to design authenticated key agreement schemes. The inclusion of PUF significantly enhances the system’s resistance to physical attacks, preventing tampering attempts. To ensure data integrity when stored on the cloud, our framework incorporates blockchain technology. By leveraging the immutability and decentralization of the blockchain, BASF-ITS effectively safeguards data at rest, providing an additional layer of security. We rigorously analyze the security of BASF-ITS and demonstrate its strong resistance against potential security ass aults, making it a robust and reliable solution for smart vehicle-enabled ITS. In a comparative analysis with contemporary competing schemes, BASF-ITS emerges as a promising approach, offering superior functionality traits, enhanced security features, and reduced computation, communication, and storage costs. Furthermore, we present a practical implementation of BASF-ITS using blockchain technology, showcasing the computational time versus the “transactions per block” and the “number of mined blocks”, confirming its efficiency and viability in real-world scenarios. Note to Practitioners—This article is motivated by designing an efficient, lightweight, and anonymous blockchain-enabled authenticated security framework that can fix the security and privacy concerns in insecure environments for ITS applications, such as automated road speed enforcement, collision avoidance alarm systems, and traffic planning and management, etc. Authenticated key agreement schemes are extensively used to secure communications in the ITS environment. However, the existing state-of-the-art schemes are not efficient in terms of performance, are not resilient against potential security attacks, and do not support anonymity, untraceability, and unlinkability. Therefore, we propose the authenticated security framework to secure communication among the participating entities in the ITS environment. It utilizes efficient cryptographic primitives, such as hash function, XOR-operator, ASCON, elliptic curve cryptography, and PUF. It is shown that the proposed framework can be deployed as a robust tool to address the ITS security problems efficiently. Moreover, the proposed framework is lightweight and efficient and can be easily deployed in various ITS applications and other resource-constrained environments. However, the participating entities, such as vehicles and roadside units, must be PUF-enabled to deploy the proposed framework.","1558-3783","","10.1109/TASE.2024.3381068","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10487806","Internet of vehicles;intelligent transportation system;authentication;key agreement;blockchain;security","Security;Blockchains;Authentication;Hash functions;Servers;Elliptic curve cryptography;Vehicular ad hoc networks","","","","45","IEEE","2 Apr 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

AI-powered solutions allow autonomous vehicles (AVs) to respond to potential hazards, navigate complex environments, make intelligent decisions, and examine real-time data. BC technologies offer secure and decentralized platforms for data management and sharing, fostering trust and cooperation among different stakeholders in the transportation system. An Autonomous Transport System (ATS) for secure vehicle and cargo matching intends to enhance and optimize transportation by using AVs and ensuring the secure transportation of goods. This mechanism combined AV technology, secure matching, and cargo tracking methods to securely and efficiently transport goods from one place to another. In this aspect, this article presents a Blockchain Assisted Vehicle and Cargo Matching using Optimal Fuzzy Restricted Boltzmann Machine (BAVCM-OFRBM) technique for Autonomous Transport System. The major aim of the BAVCM-OFRBM technique lies in the development of an automated vehicle and cargo matching approach using an optimal DL model. In addition, the BAVCM-OFRBM technique makes use of BC technology to secure transportation details such as order and shipment information. Moreover, the BAVCM-OFRBM technique exploits the FRBM model for the selection of appropriate vehicles and cargo for transportation purposes. Finally, the efficacy of the FRBM model can be improved by the use of Ingenious Crow Search Algorithm (ICSA) based hyperparameter tuning process. The simulation results of the BAVCM-OFRBM technique are tested under different aspects.

However, there are security-specific challenges with the authentication of drones while airborne. The current authentication approaches, in most drone-based applications, are subject to latency issues in real time with security vulnerabilities for attacks. To address such issues, we introduce a secure authentication model with low latency for drones in smart cities that looks to leverage blockchain technology. We apply a zone-based architecture in a network of drones, and use a customized decentralized consensus, known as drone-based delegated proof of stake (DDPOS), for drones among zones in a smart city that does not require reauthentication. The proposed architecture aims for positive impacts on increased security and reduced latency on the Internet of Drones (IoD). Moreover, we provide an empirical analysis of the proposed architecture compared to other peer models previously proposed for IoD to demonstrate its performance and security authentication capability. The experimental results clearly show that not only does the proposed architecture have low packet loss rate, high throughput, and low end-to-end delay in comparison to peer models but also can detect 97.5% of attacks by malicious drones while airborne.","2327-4662","","10.1109/JIOT.2020.3015382","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9163144","Authentication;blockchain;decentralized authentication;drone security;drones;Internet of Things (IoT)","Drones;Authentication;Smart cities;Internet of Things;Computer architecture","","124","","27","IEEE","10 Aug 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Although many aggregate signcryption (ASC) schemes have been presented to satisfy this requirement, they still suffer from performance deficiencies or security weaknesses. To address these issues, we design a more practical “Perception-Network-Application” IoT-enabled MTS (PNA-IMTS) network structure. Then, we propose an efficient Identity-based aggregate signcryption scheme with blockchain (B-ID-ASC) for PNA-IMTS based on this network model. The security analysis shows that the B-ID-ASC scheme is capable of providing confidentiality and unforgeability. It also can resist existing known attacks (impersonation attack, modification attack, man-in-the-middle attack).

All tasks performed by the maritime transport system require continuous monitoring of the vessel performance, and for this, different IoT devices are installed on the vessel board. The IoT devices collect data related to the physical parameters of the vessel and share it with the coast-side servers. As the shared data contains confidential information about the vessel, there is a need for secure data sharing techniques, allowing only the authenticated personals to access the data received from the maritime IoT devices.

The identification, traceability, and real-time tracking of goods in supply chains have always been a challenge. The advent of the Internet of Things and cloud computing has brought a new approach to the food supply chain process for better cooperation among supply chain partners.

These technologies collect the data relevant to the food supply chain system, such as identifying tag-possessed objects or individuals and sensing capabilities of the surrounding environment. However, the collected data can be tempered or modified by attackers to provide false information about environmental conditions. They can destroy or damage the product due to false identification of dynamic environmental conditions.

In the RMFS, robots lift and carry shelving units, called inventory pods, from storage locations to picking stations where workers pick items off the pods and put them into shipping cartons. The robots then return the pods to the storage area and transport other pods. In this article, we consider an item assignment problem in the RMFS in order to maximize the sum of similarity values of items in each pod. We especially focus on a reoptimization heuristic to address the situation where the similarity values are altered so that a good assignment solution can be obtained quickly with the changed similarity values. A constructive heuristic algorithm for the item assignment problem is developed, and then, a reoptimization heuristic is proposed based on the constructive heuristic algorithm. Then, computational results for several instances of the problem with 10-500 items are presented. We further analyze the case for which an item type can be placed into two pods. Note to Practitioners-This article proposes an efficient heuristic algorithm for assigning items to pods in a robotic mobile fulfillment system (RMFS) so that items ordered together frequently are put into the same pod. Computational results with 10-500 items show that the gaps from upper bounds are very small on average. For cases where the similarity values between items change or their estimation is not accurate due to the fluctuations in demand, a reoptimization heuristic algorithm that alters the original assignment is developed. The experimental results show that the reoptimization algorithm is robust when perturbation levels are approximately 40%-50% of the original similarity values with much less computation times. We believe that this research work can be very helpful for operating the RMFS efficiently.","1558-3783","","10.1109/TASE.2020.2979897","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9046292","Heuristic algorithm;item assignment problem;robotic mobile fulfillment system (RMFS);stock location problem;warehouse automation system","Heuristic algorithms;Automation;Clustering algorithms;Synchronization","","27","","35","IEEE","24 Mar 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The AIS is a self-reporting system that uses the VHF radio link. However, any radio-based self-reporting system is prone to forgery, especially in situations where authentication of the message is not designed into the architecture. As AIS was designed in the 1990s when cyberattacks were in their infancy, it does not implement authentication or encryption; thus, it can be seen as fundamentally vulnerable against cyberattacks. This paper demonstrates and evaluates the impact of multiple cyberattacks on AIS via remote radio frequency (RF) links using transmission-enabled software-defined radio (SDR). Overall, we implemented and tested a total of 11 different tests/attacks on 19 AIS setups, using a controlled environment. The tested configurations were derived from heterogeneous platforms such as Windows, Android, generic receivers, and commercial transponders. Our aim is to enhance the early discovery of new vulnerabilities in AIS to effectively address AIS attacks in the nearest future. The results showed that approximately 89% of the setups were affected by Denial-of-Service (DoS) attacks at the AIS protocol level. Besides implementing some existing attack ideas (e.g., spoofing, DoS, and flooding), we showed some novel attack concepts in the AIS context such as a coordinated attack, overwhelming alerts, and logical vulnerabilities, all of which have the potential to cause software/system crashes in the worst-case scenarios. Moreover, an implementation/specification flaw related to the AIS preamble was identified during the experiments, which may affect the interoperability of different AIS devices. The error-handling system in AIS was also investigated. Unlike the aviation sector’s Automatic Dependent Surveillance-Broadcast (ADS-B), the maritime sector’s AIS does not effectively support any error correction method, which may contribute to RF pollution and less effective use of the overall system. The consistency of our results for a comprehensive range of hardware-software configurations indicated the reliability of our approach, test system, and evaluation results.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2022.3158943","Finnish Grid and Cloud Infrastructure (FGCI) (persistent identifier urn:nbn:fi:research-infras-2016072533); Decision of the Research Dean on Research Funding within the Faculty of Information Technology of the University of Jyväskylä; Finnish Cultural Foundation(grant numbers:Decision 00211119); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9733358","AIS;attacks;cybersecurity;DoS;maritime;resiliency;ship","Artificial intelligence;Receivers;Marine vehicles;Computer crime;Security;Protocols;Base stations","","16","","39","CCBY","11 Mar 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Rooftop solar photovoltaic (PV) system provides a small-scale utilization of solar energy on the roofs of apartment buildings. Investment in this system and its profitability depends on several factors, including geographic conditions, electricity price, and local load profiles. However, in Finland, the maritime and continental climates and electrically heated residential buildings present unique challenges to the investment and utilization of rooftop PV systems. Common solutions to incentivize the investment of grid-connected PV in apartments are battery energy storage systems (BESSs), demand side management (DSM), and power-to-x (P2X) approaches. Nevertheless, the value of these solutions is limited in Finland due to the seasonal variation of solar PV generation and customers’ energy consumption. This paper presents a novel and practical control and hedging mechanism to encourage investments in rooftop solar PV-BESS systems by investing in cryptocurrency mining devices (CMDs) as dispatchable and flexible loads, which facilitate the use of excess renewable energy for producing cryptocurrency, such as bitcoin (BTC). This mechanism can optimally switch the output of excessive renewable energy between exporting to the main grid and mining cryptocurrency. The proposed mechanism is studied using a dataset obtained from a residential apartment building in Helsinki, Finland, and its effectiveness is demonstrated through several practical scenarios. The results of a case study employed in this work demonstrate that the proposed hedging mechanism can provide sufficient encouragement for investors to invest in a PV system, with a return on investment equal to 57.7%. This mechanism also reduces the annual cost of residential apartments by 68.1%.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2023.3290909","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10168101","Battery energy storage system;building energy management;cryptocurrency mining;renewable energy;photovoltaic","Cryptocurrency;Investment;Costs;Renewable energy sources;Economics;Energy consumption;Photovoltaic systems;Battery management systems;Building management systems","","2","","46","CCBYNCND","28 Jun 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

"Robot Packing With Known Items and Nondeterministic Arrival Order","F. Wang; K.

The goal is to certify that the items can be packed in a given container and/or to optimize the size or cost of a container so that that the items are guaranteed to be packable, regardless of arrival order. The nondeterministically ordered packing (NDOP) variant asks to generate a certificate that a packing plan exists for every ordering of items. Quasi-online packing (QOP) asks to generate a partially observable packing policy that chooses the location of each item as their arrival order is revealed one-by-one, with all of the remaining items certified to be packable regardless of their future arrival order. Theoretical analysis demonstrates that even the simple subproblem of verifying the feasibility of a packing policy is NP-complete. Despite this worst case complexity, practical solvers for both NDOP and QOP are developed. Multiple extensions to the basic nondeterministic problem are presented, including packing with a fixed-capacity buffer and packing with equivalent objects. Experiments demonstrate that these algorithms can be applied to packing irregular 3-D shapes with stability and manipulator loading constraints. Note to Practitioners—Automatic packing of objects into containers, such as a shipping box, has applications in warehouse automation for e-commerce applications and less-than-truckload shipping. In many scenarios, a container needs to be preselected for a set of objects before they arrive, and the order of the objects cannot be controlled. This article studies the theoretical foundations of packing problems, in which the set of items is known, but the arrival order is unknown. The algorithms presented in this article can certify whether a container can hold a set of objects in the case where the arrival order is revealed at once, one-by-one, and where a limited set of objects can be put aside in a buffer before packing. These algorithms can be used to choose optimal containers and packing strategies, both for robot and human packers.","1558-3783","","10.1109/TASE.2020.3024291","Amazon Research Award; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9205914","Bin packing;computational complexity;nondeterminism;robotics","Containers;Robots;Collision avoidance;Shape;Computational complexity;Automation","","23","","26","CCBY","25 Sep 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The train load can be realized considering different objectives, in this work we focus on two very important objectives for terminal managers, that are the minimization of the number of reshuffles in the storage area and the minimization of the total distance covered by the handling equipment between the storage area and the wagons. To address this problem, some multi-objective methods are investigated in the paper, based on the  $\varepsilon $ -constraint approach and the lexicographic algorithm, allowing to find different sets of efficient solutions to be provided to train planners. The experimental tests, devised to compare the proposed multi-objective methods, show that the  $\varepsilon $ -constraint method integrated with a lexicographic approach is the most efficient choice since it allows to obtain a higher number of efficient solutions in shorter computational times. This method can be applied in decision support systems for train planners in order to allow them to decide the train load in an efficient way. Note to Practitioners—The automation and the process optimization in seaport container terminals is a relevant issue for terminal managers in order to face the strong competitiveness in the logistics and shipping sector and the new emerging problems due to the presence of mega vessels. Among the different operations to be optimally managed in a terminal, the loading of trains is becoming more and more significant, also due to the increase of freight traffic by rail, seen as a cheaper and more sustainable option compared with road transport. The optimal assignment of containers present in a storage area to the wagon slots is a crucial decision in order to reduce operational times and costs in a container terminal. In this paper, we address the train load planning problem considering two important objectives to be minimized, i.e. the number of reshuffles and the distance covered by the handling equipment. The multi-objective methods proposed in the paper are devised to find different efficient solutions in short computational times.

A significant challenge is the optimization and automation of loading and unloading systems, given their complexity and repetitive nature. Advances in automated systems, through ongoing research and application in various transportation scenarios, are addressing these challenges. However, automating vehicles alone is insufficient; it is also important to have a connected, infrastructure-based collaborative framework to manage the complex logistics of port operations effectively and in a synchronized manner.

Still, the exchange of training data might raise privacy concerns of the involved stakeholders. Towards this end, federated learning (FL), a decentralized ML approach, enables collaborative model training across multiple distributed edge devices, such as on-board sensors and unmanned vessels and vehicles.

Conventionally, the efficiency of the stowage planning algorithms are improved by pruning or reducing the search space. We observe that constraint evaluation is the core of most algorithms. In addition, the order at which the constraints are evaluated can have significant impact on the efficiency of the constraint evaluation engine. We propose random sample model (RSM) and sequential sample model (SSM) for analysis of the problem. We present and evaluate seven strategies in optimizing the constraint evaluation engine. We show how to achieve the optimal constraint ordering with respect to RSM and SSM, respectively. However, the optimal ordering for SSM requires perfect information about the states of the constraint tests, which is impractical. We present an alternative strategy and show empirically that its efficiency is close to the optimal. Experiments show that, compared to a naïve ordering, an average of 2.74 times speed up in the evaluation engine can be achieved. Note to Practitioners—Automated stowage planning has become a trend as the number of mega-scale containerships being deployed has increased drastically over the past decade. Due to the nature of the problem, it is impractical to expect the best stowage plan within a limited amount of time, and hence, many heuristics have been devised to reduce the solution space. Many heuristics algorithms share a common core-repeatedly selecting a stowage slot and a container (selection mechanism) and evaluate whether all of the constraints are satisfied. To improve the efficiency, most studies aim to reduce the number of location-container pairs being considered. We consider an alternative approach that improves the efficiency of the constraint evaluation engine. Specifically, we show how to improve the efficiency by strategically reordering the sequence in which the constraints are evaluated. With the improvements on the efficiency, the stowage algorithm is one step closer to being able to generate solutions in real time. This may enable the shipping companies to take last-minute shipment order and react to changes in demands quickly.","1558-3783","","10.1109/TASE.2017.2779470","NOL Fellowship Program; Singapore Maritime Institute; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8245909","Automation;logistics;Markov processes;optimization methods;testing","Containers;Planning;Engines;Ports (Computers);Stacking;Marine vehicles;Heuristic algorithms","","6","","32","IEEE","3 Jan 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The dynamic nature of marine environments, where ships traverse vast and unpredictable expanses of oceans and seas, presents big challenges to safety and risk management. Wireless communication technology is widely employed in maritime activities for communication via ocean networks and underwater wireless sensor networks (UWSNs). Maintaining the safety of the maritime environment, effective anomaly detection, prompt risk mitigation, and real-time communication becomes more difficult due to its dynamic nature. International trade and transportation are facilitated by the maritime industry. In addition to protecting lives and averting environmental disasters, maritime safety is important for maintaining the effectiveness and dependability of shipping routes. To handle the intricacies of maritime safety, this work proposes a novel preventive framework for anomaly detection and risk management in Maritime Wireless Communications (MWC). The proposed framework is based on edge computing and machine learning models. The framework makes use of edge computing technology to process data locally, lowering latency and enabling real-time communication in maritime environments. A proactive safety approach has been adopted to ensure the well-being of seafarers, safeguard vessels, and protect the marine environment. As maritime cybersecurity threats continue to evolve, the proposed research aims to enhance the cybersecurity posture of MWC. The framework will incorporate measures to detect and respond to potential cyber threats, ensuring the integrity and security of communication channels under international maritime cybersecurity standards. The proposed anomaly detection framework incorporates machine learning models such as Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and Isolation Forests (IF). The proposed framework also places a strong emphasis on preventative safety measures, including cybersecurity safeguards to protect communication channels in the constantly changing digital marine operations environment. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework, the experiments were performed based on a publicly available dataset and implemented in the context of marine communications. The results show significant accuracy as well as high precision, recall, and F1-score metrics generated by the LSTM and IF models. The results highlight that the proposed framework can detect anomalies and potential threats in real-time marine communications.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2024.3387529","Deanship of Scientific Research at King Khalid University(grant numbers:R.G.P.2/93/45); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10496686","Machine learning;intelligent systems;sustainable navigation;autonomous vessels;ship safety management systems;maritime shipping;satellite technology;sensing and communication in maritime;automatic identification system;edge computing;prevention of ship accidents","Safety;Wireless communication;Edge computing;Real-time systems;Marine vehicles;Computer security;Machine learning;Maritime communications;Accidents","","2","","50","CCBYNCND","11 Apr 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

However, the uncertain and dynamic maritime environment presents challenges that hamper the achievement of proper situational awareness in route transportation. In the case of ocean transportation, detecting the anomalous behavior of vessels in such an unpredictable environment promotes the rapid achievement of successful situational awareness. To detect abnormal behavior of vessels, we propose a novel statistical anomaly detector in a grid-based structure. To overcome the drawback of the grid-based approach when the monitored area is large, we divide the monitored area into multiple grids by selecting intermediate cells. For each grid, the proposed method extracts a normal representation, called a baseline, from historical AIS data combined with bill-of-lading data. Bayesian bootstrap techniques are adopted to quantify any uncertainty in the baseline and to compute the probability that each route will be abnormal. Based on the computed probability, the proposed method enables real-time spatial and temporal maritime traffic monitoring. The effectiveness of the proposed method is evaluated using simulated data and real data from maritime logistics. Note to Practitioners—Maritime logistics is a crucial aspect of the global economy, but the unpredictable and dynamic maritime environment poses challenges for situational awareness during transportation. Detecting abnormal behavior of vessels in ocean transportation can significantly contribute to achieving situational awareness. To address this challenge, we present a new statistical anomaly detector in a grid-based structure. We divided the monitored area into multiple grids and extracted a normal representation, called a baseline, for each grid from historical AIS data combined with bill-of-lading data. The proposed method enables real-time spatial and temporal maritime traffic monitoring, which is especially effective for large monitored areas.

Such vessels need perception for two purposes: to perform autonomous situational awareness and to monitor the integrity of the sensor system itself. In order to meet these needs, the perception system must fuse data from novel and traditional perception sensors using Artificial Intelligence (AI) techniques. This article overviews the recognized operational requirements that are imposed on regular and autonomous seafaring vessels, and then proceeds to consider suitable sensors and relevant AI techniques for an operational sensor system. The integration of four sensors families is considered: sensors for precise absolute positioning (Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) receivers and Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU)), visual sensors (monocular and stereo cameras), audio sensors (microphones), and sensors for remote-sensing (RADAR and LiDAR). Additionally, sources of auxiliary data, such as Automatic Identification System (AIS) and external data archives are discussed. The perception tasks are related to well-defined problems, such as situational abnormality detection, vessel classification, and localization, that are solvable using AI techniques. Machine learning methods, such as deep learning and Gaussian processes, are identified to be especially relevant for these problems. The different sensors and AI techniques are characterized keeping in view the operational requirements, and some example state-of-the-art options are compared based on accuracy, complexity, required resources, compatibility and adaptability to maritime environment, and especially towards practical realization of autonomous systems.","1558-0016","","10.1109/TITS.2020.3023957","European Space Agency conducted within the Artificial Intelligence/Machine Learning Sensor Fusion for Autonomous Vessel Navigation Project under the NAVISP Element 1 Funding Program; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9207841","Positioning;camera;microphone;LiDAR;RADAR;machine learning;GNSS;sensor fusion;maritime","Marine vehicles;Sensor systems;Artificial intelligence;Intelligent sensors;Global navigation satellite system","","107","","146","CCBY","28 Sep 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Meanwhile, the IoT devices are resource-constrained and cannot implement the existing security systems, making them susceptible to various types of debilitating cyber-attacks. The dynamics in the attack processes in IoT-enabled MTS networks keep changing, which makes a traditional offline or batch ML-based attack detection systems intractable to apply. This paper provides a novel approach of using an adaptive incremental passive-aggressive machine learning (AI-PAML) method to create a network attack detection system (NADS) to protect the IoT devices in an MTS environment. In this paper, we propose an NADS that utilizes a multi-access edge computing (MEC) platform to provide computational resources to execute the proposed model at a network end. Since online learning models face data saturation problems, we present an improved approximate linear dependence and a modified hybrid forgetting mechanism to filter the inefficient data and keep the detection model up-to-date. The proposed data filtering ensures that the model does not experience a rapid increase in unwarranted data, which affects the model’s attack detection rate. A Markov transition probability is applied to control the MEC selection and data offloading process by the IoT devices. The performance of the NADS is verified using selected benchmark datasets and a realistic IoT environment. Experimental results demonstrate that AI-PAML achieves remarkable performance in the NADS design for an MTS environment.","1558-0016","","10.1109/TITS.2022.3159450","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9740512","Internet of Things;task offloading;multi-access edge computing;cloud computing;maritime transport system;intrusion detection","Security;Servers;Internet of Things;Task analysis;Data models;Sensors;Performance evaluation","","11","","30","IEEE","23 Mar 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In real situations of such scenarios, it is a common requirement that the model can recognize novel classes incrementally, namely class-incremental learning (CIL). Considering the above requirement, a novel problem that recognizes novel classes incrementally when both the base and novel class samples are scarce is proposed in this article. It is called complete few-shot CIL (C-FSCIL) for distinguishing from the FSCIL that assumes sufficient samples of base classes. Specifically, the following challenges of C-FSCIL are focused on: 1) distance measurement is used for recognizing novel classes incrementally, but the encoder is difficult to be learned well when base class samples are scarce, making some features unsuitable for calculating the distance, decreasing the performance and 2) the catastrophic forgetting problem becomes more difficult to be alleviated than that in FSCIL because of the scarcity of base class samples. To tackle both challenges, mine-distill-prototypes (MDP) algorithm is proposed, which consists of two parts: 1) prototypes-distillation (PD) network is proposed to learn to distill the features and prototypes into a lower dimensional in which ineffective features are eliminated and 2) the prototypes-weight (PW) network and the prototypes-selection (PS) training strategy are proposed for the catastrophic forgetting problem, which aims to capture the relationship between the base and novel prototypes. The superior performance of the proposed algorithm is demonstrated by the experiments on three datasets.","1558-0644","","10.1109/TGRS.2023.3248601","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:41371339); Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities(grant numbers:2017KFYXJJ179); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10052684","Few-shot class-incremental learning (FSCIL);infrared images;synthetic aperture radar (SAR)","Prototypes;Training;Power capacitors;Feature extraction;Pipelines;Synthetic aperture radar;Distance measurement","","5","","46","IEEE","24 Feb 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In recent years, bolstered by deep learning, ship detection has also grown by leaps and bounds. Nevertheless, existing methods still suffer from two challenging issues: 1) imprecise localization for low discriminative ships under the complicated background and 2) missed detections for small ships. To solve the above issues, we propose a novel ship detection method equipped with a saliency-guided feature fusion network (SGFFN) and a dynamic IoU-adaptive strategy (DIAS). SGFFN is designed based on a top-down feature pyramid network to introduce saliency information into the ship detection network and optimize the saliency-aware features. It comprises two components: the resolution-matching saliency supervision (RMS) network and the cross-stage saliency integration network (CSIN). RMS is a bimatching mechanism that adopts diverse prediction structures for the saliency maps with different scales, such that the finer saliency-aware features could be obtained. CSIN is a cross-stage cross-channel integration module that is designed to fuse saliency-aware features with low-level features. Furthermore, a customized training strategy for small ships, i.e., DIAS, is devised to assign appropriate intersection over union (IoU) thresholds for anchors around the small ships during the training phase. Experimental results on two datasets demonstrate that our proposed method achieves state-of-the-art performance.","1558-0644","","10.1109/TGRS.2024.3367959","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:62106266,62173328,U22B2048,61973027); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10440362","Deep learning;high-resolution optical images;remote sensing;saliency detection;ship detection","Marine vehicles;Feature extraction;Object detection;Saliency detection;Remote sensing;Optical sensors;Optical imaging","","","","82","IEEE","20 Feb 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

We find that TBCC is a salient structural property of the GLSN and is strongly associated with international trade statuses. Ports that appear more frequently in TBCCs tend to gain higher container throughputs in reality and play more important roles in maintaining the overall network robustness. Furthermore, we find that countries belonging to the same TBCCs tend to have closer trading relationships and form meaningful multilateral trade clusters in the future.

This paper investigates the development of next-generation smart ports, wherein the integration of Internet of Things (IoT) and sensors transforms ports into intelligent hubs. This transformation aims to optimize operations for all stakeholders, that leverage emerging technologies to enhance efficiency and connectivity. Notably, many smaller seaports lack shore-power facilities, shore-based power installations that supply electric power to ships from the grid. Consequently, ships often rely on continuous operation of auxiliary diesel engines and generators while at berth to meet auxiliary loads. To address these challenges and overcome economic and logistical constraints, this paper proposes a seaport microgrid (SMG) with a DC distribution that would be created by integrating multiple ships with decentralized control mechanisms supplemented by an onshore charging infrastructure. This helps to achieve a sustainable path by introducing ship-based SMGs involving the integration of shipboard microgrids with onshore charging. The proposed approach relies on adaptive droop control, decentralized power-sharing based on battery charge and reducing traditional communication dependencies.

Key stakeholders in this effort include maritime institutions and shipping companies. However, effectively organizing information from ship emission monitoring, especially for policy implementation in the expansion of emission control areas (ECAs), faces substantial obstacles in data acquisition, transmission, analysis, and information services. To address these challenges, this study suggests an Internet of Things (IoT) paradigm using drones and deep learning for ship emission monitoring in the port areas, integrating vital technologies such as industrial contact elements for the IoT, assisted processing of ship emission, real-time data monitoring and online processing, and tailored information services for port control center. In addition, the suggested IoT paradigm considers adversarial and false data injection (FDI) assaults, which impair the effectiveness of data processing and identification techniques. By actively supporting green port trends and maritime law enforcement, this new IoT paradigm is developing into the framework of the berth area inside the physical infrastructure. Furthermore, this model highlights the possibility for a more widespread adoption of ship pollution monitoring while simultaneously demonstrating the model’s efficacy in the current setting. A more expansive version of the suggested IoT paradigm might function as a strong cyber-physical infrastructure, supporting the capacity for thorough ship emission monitoring and enabling in-depth study on ship emissions.","1557-9662","","10.1109/TIM.2024.3374306","National Kaohsiung University of Science and Technology; National Science and Technology Council(grant numbers:112-2218-E-992-005); Ministry of Science and Technology of Taiwan(grant numbers:MOST 110-2221-E-992-044-MY3); Contact Software Company of IoT Platform; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10462153","Adversarial attacks;cybersecurity;deep learning;Internet of Things (IoT);ship emission","Marine vehicles;Monitoring;Seaports;Drones;Fuels;Continuous wavelet transforms;Generators","","","","43","IEEE","7 Mar 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The success of these missions largely relies on motion planning algorithms that can generate optimal navigational trajectories to guide a USV. Apart from minimising the distance of a path, when deployed a USVs’ motion planning algorithms also need to consider other constraints such as energy consumption, the affected of ocean currents as well as the fast collision avoidance capability. In this paper, we propose a new algorithm named anisotropic GPMP2 to revolutionise motion planning for USVs based upon the fundamentals of GP (Gaussian process) motion planning (GPMP, or its updated version GPMP2). Firstly, we integrated the anisotropy into GPMP2 to make the generated trajectories follow ocean currents where necessary to reduce energy consumption on resisting ocean currents. Secondly, to further improve the computational speed and trajectory quality, a dynamic fast GP interpolation is integrated in the algorithm. Finally, the new algorithm has been validated on a WAM-V 20 USV in a ROS environment to show the practicability of anisotropic GPMP2. Note to Practitioners—The work reported in this article will be significant for USVs to conduct missions in complex, dynamic maritime environments where various obstacles and time-varying ocean currents exit. We develop this novel motion planning algorithm based on Gaussian process and optimise the trajectory using probabilistic inferences. The new algorithm can generate collision free trajectories that also minimise the influences caused by adverse ocean currents in a highly efficient way. In addition, the planning has been undertaken in a continuous-time domain making the generated trajectory have a guaranteed smoothness and readily feasible for autopilots to track. We use a coastal area with time-varying vortexes to present a challenging practical maritime environment. The presented algorithm integrates the available information about a fluid field regarding energy consumption and hazard level, along with the density of obstacles to plan a navigational route efficiently. To increase the practical performance of the proposed method, diverse models for generating ocean currents need to be developed in the future to tackle unpredictable situations.","1558-3783","","10.1109/TASE.2021.3139163","Royal Society(grant numbers:IEC-NSFC-191633); University College London (UCL) and Rutgers University through the International Collaborative Research Grant from Rutgers Global at Rutgers, The State University of New Jersey; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9674026","Unmanned surface vehicles;ocean currents;anisotropy;continuous-time motion planning;Gaussian process","Motion planning;Path planning;Gaussian processes;Probabilistic logic;Marine vehicles","","21","","48","IEEE","7 Jan 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

DP systems play a central role in several marine operations, such as drilling, pipe-laying, coring, and ocean observation. These operations are the primary cause of fuel consumption, having a strong impact on the overall footprint of the vessel. For this reason, we will face the problem of optimal thrust allocation of an over-actuated vessel to maintain position and heading with minimal fuel consumption. State-of-the-art approaches simplify this problem by roughly approximating it and obtain a simple, mostly convex, optimization problem that can be solved in near-real time by the automation system. In this article, we improve current approaches with the following contributions. We will exploit a higher fidelity representation of the physical system, and we will manipulate the resulting optimization problem accordingly, to allow for near-real-time solutions on conventional computing platforms on-board. We evaluate the quality of the proposal with a case study on a drilling unit equipped with six thrusters. The results will show that it is possible to achieve up to 5% of fuel savings with respect to conventional approaches. Note to Practitioners—This article was motivated by the problem of minimizing fuel consumption in thrust allocation of DP systems. The current approaches simplify this issue by adopting simpler, yet related, optimization problems as surrogates, keeping the problem tractable for near-real-time control. We propose, instead, to solve the original problem with state-of-the-art modelization of the physical system and exploit reasonable and theoretical proprietaries to achieve optimal solutions in near-real-time.

However, many ship detection methods get troubles on the movable platform, which are summarized as follows: 1) high time efficiency is needed to handle the rapid changing of maritime scenes so that ships can be detected successfully on movable platform; 2) different appearances caused by sizes and viewpoints enlarge the intra-class distance of ships, which exceed the representation capability of some features like histogram of oriented gradients (HOG) with fixed size. For addressing these issues, we propose a rapid ship detection method based on multi-size gradient features and multi-branch support vector machine (SVM) in a “coarse-to-fine” manner that can be applied on a movable platform. The proposed multi-size gradient features are used to represent the ships with different sizes, including the coarse and fine gradient features. To speed up the detection process in a sliding way, the coarse ship locations are firstly generated only based on the coarse gradient features, which highly reduces the computational cost. Then, the multi-size gradient features extracted from these locations are determined by a multi-branch SVM model which is designed to deal with features of different dimensions and improve the precision of ship position with fine gradient features. The proposed method is tested on the changing background where ships have different sizes. Experimental results show that the proposed method obtains average precision (AP) of 0.795 and its detection speed achieves 60.6 frame per second, which achieve real-time performance and satisfactory detection precision.","1558-0016","","10.1109/TITS.2020.3024919","Ocean Public Welfare Scientific Research Project(grant numbers:201505002); National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61305038,61273249); Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities (SCUT)(grant numbers:2019MS139); Basic and Applied Basic Research Foundation of Guangdong Province(grant numbers:2019A1515011148); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9210194","Movable platform;multi-branch support vector machine;multi-size gradient feature;rapid ship detection","Marine vehicles;Feature extraction;Support vector machines;Microsoft Windows;Object detection;Visualization;Videos","","8","","36","IEEE","30 Sep 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Several NSB-IK approaches existing in the literature are reviewed, and compared with a reverse priority approach, which originated in manipulator control, and is here applied for the first time to the considered problem. All NSB-IK approaches are here described in a unified formalism, which allows (i) to encode the property of each controller into a set of seven main key features, (ii) to study possible new control laws with an opportune choice of these parameters. Furthermore, motivated by the envisioned application scenario, we tackle the problem of task-switching activation.

The computer vision technique with an excellent price-to-performance ratio has become a popular medium to estimate vessel draft depth. However, the traditional estimation methods easily suffer from several limitations, such as sensitivity to low-quality images, high computational cost, etc. In this work, we propose a multi-task learning-enabled computational method (termed MTL-VDR) for generating highly reliable VDR. In particular, our MTL-VDR mainly consists of four components, i.e., draft mark detection, draft scale recognition, vessel/water segmentation, and final draft depth estimation. We first construct a benchmark dataset related to draft mark detection and employ a powerful and efficient convolutional neural network to accurately perform the detection task. The multi-task learning method is then proposed for simultaneous draft scale recognition and vessel/water segmentation. To obtain more robust VDR under complex conditions (e.g., damaged and stained scales, etc.), the accurate draft scales are generated by an automatic correction method, which is presented based on the spatial distribution rules of draft scales. Finally, an adaptive computational method is exploited to yield an accurate and robust draft depth. Extensive experiments have been implemented on the realistic dataset to compare our MTL-VDR with state-of-the-art methods.

In particular, to represent various correlations among spatio-temporal vessel traffic flow, we tend to extract the feature points (i.e., starting, way and ending points) by utilizing the knowledge of vessel positioning data. These feature points are essentially related to the geometrical structures of massive vessel trajectories collected from massive automatic identification system (AIS) records, contributing to the generation of maritime traffic network. We then propose a spatio-temporal multi-graph convolutional network (STMGCN)-based vessel traffic flow prediction method by exploiting multiple types of inherent correlations in the generated maritime graph. The proposed STMGCN mainly contains one spatial multi-graph convolutional layer and two temporal gated convolutional layers, beneficial for extracting spatial and temporal traffic flow patterns.

For multifarious cyber-attacks, Intrusion Detection System (IDS) is one of the efficient mechanisms to prevent IoT devices from network intrusion. However, most of the methods based on deep learning train their models in a centralized manner, which needs uploading all data to the central server for training, increasing the risk of privacy disclosure. In this paper, we consider the characteristics of IoT-based MTS and propose a CNN-MLP based model for intrusion detection which is trained through Federated Learning, named FedBatch. Federated Learning keeps the model training local and only updates the global model through the exchange of model parameters, preserving the privacy of local data on vessels. First, the characteristics of the communication between different vessels are discussed to model the federated learning process during the voyage. Then, the lightweight local model constructed by Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and Multi-Layer Perception (MLP) is designed to save on computing and storage overhead. Moreover, to mitigate the straggler problem during the federated learning in MTS, we proposed an adaptive aggregation method, named Batch Federated Aggregation, which suppresses the oscillations of model parameters during federated learning.

This paper addresses the environmental concerns related to fuel consumption and carbon emission within shipping operations and simultaneously presents strategies for countering disruption within the maritime transportation domain. Several studies addressed bunker fuel management strategies, but overlooked the need for integrating it with shipping operations. This paper aims to bridge this research gap by proposing a novel mathematical model and presenting a heuristic procedure combined with a variable neighborhood search algorithm for maximizing the shipping company's profitability, while addressing the vessel routing and scheduling decisions, container loading and unloading operations, selection of bunkering ports, and determining bunkered amount for heavy fuel oil and marine diesel oil. Recovery strategies such as port swapping and rescheduling of vessel route are considered to deal with disruptions related to weather adversities. An illustrative example is presented depicting the realistic scenario and providing results associated with ship routes, vessel speed, bunkering ports, bunkered amounts, fuel consumed by the vessel on each sailing leg, arrival and departure time of the ships, etc. Insights obtained from the analysis performed based on the fuel price, ship's bunkering capacity, adverse weather conditions on various routes, port closure, carbon tax, and fuel consumption provide useful information for shipping company managers. Managerial implications are presented with regard to the impact of fuel prices and carbon tax on shipping operation from the perspective of overall operational cost. Moreover, the results provide important policy insights for shipping company managers in terms of possessing alternate vessel route options for normal scenario and disrupted scenarios including weather adversities on sailing leg or port closure.","1558-0040","","10.1109/TEM.2019.2923342","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:71571156,71831006); Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, China(grant numbers:T32-101/15-R); Seed Fund for Basic Research(grant numbers:201811159163); State Key Laboratory of Synthetical Automation for Process Industries(grant numbers:PAL-N201802); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8758221","Bunker fuel management;bunker fuel price;bunkering port;disruption within shipping logistics;maritime transportation;variable neighborhood search (VNS);vessel speed","Fuels;Marine vehicles;Containers;Transportation;Companies;Routing;Schedules","","50","","38","IEEE","9 Jul 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Existing scheduling algorithms fall short in handling these uncertainties, compromising both safety and efficiency. Moreover, these algorithms are primarily designed for nonautonomous vessels, leading to labor-intensive operations vulnerable to human error. To address these issues, this study proposes a risk-aware motion control approach for vessels that accounts for the dynamic and uncertain nature of tide islands in a distributionally robust manner. Specifically, a model predictive control (MPC) method is employed to follow the reference trajectory in the time–space map while incorporating a risk constraint to prevent grounding accidents. To address uncertainties in tide islands, a novel modeling technique represents them as stochastic polytopes. Additionally, potential inaccuracies in waterway depth are addressed through a risk constraint that considers the worst case uncertainty distribution within a Wasserstein ambiguity set around the empirical distribution. Using sensor data collected in the Guadalquivir River, we empirically demonstrate the performance of the proposed method through simulations on a vessel. As a result, the vessel successfully navigates the waterway while avoiding grounding accidents, even with a limited dataset of observations. This stands in contrast to existing nonrobust controllers, highlighting the robustness and practical applicability of the proposed approach.","1558-0865","","10.1109/TCST.2024.3355014","MCIN/AEI/10.13039/501100011033(grant numbers:PID2022-141159OBI00); “ERDF A way of making Europe,”; Fondo Europeo de Desarrollo Regional FEDER under Program Interreg V-A España-Portugal (POCTEP)(grant numbers:2014–2020); National Research Foundation of Korea(grant numbers:MSIT2020R1C1C1009766); Information and Communications Technology Planning and Evaluation(grant numbers:MSIT2022-0-00124,MSIT2022-0-00480); MCIN/AEI/10.13039/501100011033(grant numbers:PID2022-141159OBI00); “ERDF A way of making Europe.”; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10415511","Autonomous vehicles;marine safety;marine transportation;motion control","Motion control;Accidents;Uncertainty;Rivers;Grounding;Robot sensing systems;Navigation;Autonomous vehicles;Marine safety;Risk management","","2","","39","IEEE","29 Jan 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Dynamic target tracking technology has wide application potential in fields such as maritime rescue, countering illegal fishing, border and coastal defense. These tasks always necessitate the USVs intercepting the target with a specified Line-of-Sight (LOS) angle. In the majority of existing moving target tracking methodologies, the constraints associated with the terminal LOS angle have not been comprehensively studied. Addressing these issues, a target tracking guidance, constrained by the terminal LOS angle, is presented to guide the defender USVs in tracking a moving target in a specific direction. In the context of the general target tracking problem, the definitions of tracking errors have been precisely explained within the inertial frame. Then, the relative acceleration is derived by employing the back-stepping and mathematical induction. The course control strategy, formulated by incorporating both the relative distance and terminal LOS angle into the relative acceleration, has been developed in the horizontal plane. Distinct from existing approaches that employ switching logics to satisfy distance and angle constraints, our proposed guidance integrates angle constraints and target tracking into a unified framework, resulting in enhanced accuracy and robustness in dynamic tracking scenarios. The results of the simulations indicate that the proposed method can successfully restrain the terminal LOS angle as the relative distances decrease. The effectiveness of the proposed method has been verified via experimental results.","1939-9359","","10.1109/TVT.2024.3390001","National Key R&D Program of China(grant numbers:2022ZD0119903); National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:U2141234); Open Research Subject of State Key Laboratory of Intelligent Game(grant numbers:ZBKF-24-08); Taicang Foundation Research(grant numbers:TC2023JC25); Shanghai Science and Technology(grant numbers:19510745200); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10502349","Unmanned surface vehicle;terminal line-of-sight angle constraint;target tracking;trajectory prediction;guidance law","Target tracking;Trajectory;Kinetic theory;Vehicle dynamics;Line-of-sight propagation;Transmission line matrix methods;Mathematical models","","","","43","IEEE","16 Apr 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Many existing fleet management approaches discretize a spatiotemporal distribution to reduce the problem complexity. Although spatial discretization greatly simplifies the problems, this approximation results in a suboptimal solution. To address this limitation, we present a novel spatial discretization-free, particle-based formulation of fleet management. Our model requires only temporal discretization. The nodes in our spatiotemporal network model represent the positions of the fleet and ride requests over the time horizon. Under this representation, a taxi dispatch problem can be solved by the minimum-cost maximum-flow (MCMF) algorithm. We show some structural properties that disclose a type of monotonicity by applying the MCMF algorithm to our problem. The obtained dispatch solution maximizes the number of served requests from these structural properties at least at the most current time step, regardless of the demand prediction quality. Moreover, these properties enable the decomposition of the MCMF algorithm without sacrificing optimality, and the decomposed multistage maximum-flow algorithm is significantly faster than the MCMF algorithm. Furthermore, we propose an efficient method that alleviates the dearth of input data for service providers who lack sufficient computing power to calculate substantial travel time information. We demonstrate the performance of our method by using data collected in New York City, USA. Our simulation studies indicate that a service provider can fulfill 74–85% of the ride requests within 2 minutes.","1558-0016","","10.1109/TITS.2022.3162119","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9745824","Logistics;automation;real-time system;intelligent transportation systems;optimization","Public transportation;Vehicles;Real-time systems;Prediction algorithms;Urban areas;Roads;Spatiotemporal phenomena","","3","","29","IEEE","31 Mar 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

This issue is crucial for the competitiveness of logistic companies and is still one of the most difficult problems in internal logistics. In fact, it requires the fast solution of a three-dimensional Bin Packing Problem (3D-BPP) with additional logistic specifications that are fundamental in real applications. To this aim, we propose a matheuristics that, given a set of items, provides feasible pallets configurations that satisfy the practical requirements of items’ grouping by logistic features, load bearing, stability, height homogeneity, overhang as well as weight limits, and robotized layer picking. The proposed matheuristics combines a mixed integer linear programming (MILP) formulation of the 3D-Single Bin-Size BPP (3D-SBSBPP) and a layer building heuristics. In particular, the feasible pallets configurations are obtained by sequentially solving two MILP sub-problems: the first, given the set of items to be packed, aims at minimizing the unused space in each layer and thus the number of layers; the latter aims at minimizing the number of shipping bins given the set of layers obtained from the first problem. The approach is extensively tested and compared with existing approaches. For its validation we use both realistic data-sets drawn from the literature and real data-sets, obtained from an Italian logistics leader. The resulting outcomes show the effectiveness of the method in providing high-quality bin configurations in short computational times. Note to Practitioners—This work is motivated by the intention of facilitating the transition from Logistics 3.0 to Logistics 4.0 by providing an effective tool to automate bin packing, suitable for automated warehouses. On the one hand, the proposed technique provides stable and compact bin configurations in less than half a minute per bin on average, despite the high computational complexity of the 3D-SBSBPP. On the other hand, the approach allows to consider compatibility constraints for the items (e.g., final customer and category of the items), and the use of robotized layer picking in automated warehouses. In effect, layers composed by only one type of items (i.e., monoitem layers) can be directly picked and placed on the pallet by a robotic arm without the intervention of any operator. Consequently, the adoption of this approach in warehouses could drastically improve the efficiency of the packing process.","1558-3783","","10.1109/TASE.2022.3177422","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9787801","Logistics 4.0;bin packing;pallets configuration;matheuristics","Logistics;Pallets;Robots;Buildings;Stability criteria;Companies;Costs","","22","","38","CCBY","3 Jun 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The system consists of three modules: stowage plan generator, stability module and optimization engine. The focus of the study is on the stability module, which automatically generates feasible stowage plans that conform to safety and stability requirements for large-scale vessels. The module can greatly reduce the amount of ballast required by the ship and lower the cost of shipping. The proposed system is tested on a real-world large containership with more than 7000 TEUs on a multiport voyage. Experimental results show that the proposed system is able to efficiently generate feasible stowage plans using only a fraction of the time required by human planners (<;2 min per plan versus 2 hours per plan). The quality of the generated plans is also comparable to human planners in terms of the number of rehandles, crane intensity, safety and stability, all of which are crucial to shipping operations.","1937-9234","","10.1109/JSYST.2010.2100198","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5699924","Automation;containerships;safety;stability;stowage planning","Containers;Marine vehicles;Safety;Planning;Loading;Bridges;Cranes","","13","","18","IEEE","24 Jan 2011","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Then, the first-price sealed reverse auction with reserve price is utilized to incentivize USV fleets to assist in executing computation tasks of UAVs, where the reserve price guarantees the satisfied benefits of UAVs. Afterwards, to minimize the energy consumption of executing tasks within the USV fleet under the delay constraint, the joint allocation optimization scheme for computation subtasks and computation capacities is proposed based on the Block Coordinate Descent (BCD) and Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM).

The systems that facilitate maritime shipping are at risk of serious disruptions, and these disruptions can stem from vulnerabilities in the software and processes used in these systems. These vulnerabilities leave such systems open to cyber-attack. Assessments of the security of maritime shipping systems have focused on identifying risks but have not taken the critical (and expensive) next step of actually identifying vulnerabilities present in these systems. While such risk assessments are important, they have not provided the detailed identification of security issues in the systems that control these ports and their terminals. In response, we formed a key collaboration between an experienced academic cybersecurity team and a well-known commercial software provider that manages maritime shipping.

However, the captured images inevitably suffer from color distortion, contrast reduction, or loss of fine details under severe weather conditions (such as haze, low-lightness, rain, and snow). The quality-degraded visual information will lead to limited perceptual accuracy and range, resulting in the increased navigation risk for intelligent marine vehicles. To suppress the influences of severe imaging conditions on navigation safety, this work proposes an all-in-one low-visibility enhancement network (termed AiOENet) to improve the visual perception for marine surface vehicles under different weather scenarios. Specifically, our AiOENet mainly consists of a VGG16-driven scene discriminator, an encoder, parameter-shared Transformer blocks, and a decoder. The scene discriminator is exploited to classify four degradation types of low-visibility images. According to the classification results, the low-visibility images are fed into the corresponding encoders for coarse feature extraction. The multiple Transformer blocks are then employed to separate and extract the smaller-scale features. The latent normal-visibility images are finally generated through the corresponding decoders. Therefore, our AiOENet has the capacity of flexibly and adaptively restoring diverse low-visibility images using a uniform encoder-decoder network architecture. Compared with the state-of-the-art imaging methods, the AiOENet achieves comparable or even superior enhancement results in terms of both quantitative and qualitative evaluations. In addition, our method can contribute to more accurate and stable object detection with improved visual perception in maritime low-visibility scenes.","2379-8904","","10.1109/TIV.2023.3347952","Hainan Provincial Joint Project of Sanya Yazhou Bay Science and Technology City(grant numbers:520LH057); National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:52271365); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10375786","Deep neural network;intelligent marine vehicles;low-visibility enhancement;severe weather;visual perception","Meteorology;Imaging;Navigation;Marine vehicles;Feature extraction;Visual perception;Snow","","5","","78","IEEE","28 Dec 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

To tackle these problems, in this article, we propose a game based USV fleet-assisted data sharing scheme to facilitate data exchange among USVs. Specially, we firstly propose a data publish/subscribe framework, where USVs are categorized into publishers and subscribers, and a USV fleet is motivated as a broker to relay data from publishers to subscribers. Then, the optimal waypoints for data publishing are recommended to the USV fleet to improve its probability of acquiring data. Furthermore, a Vickrey-Clarke-Groves (VCG) reverse auction game is utilized for data publishing, which ensures that the data publishers bid for USV fleets with own truthful costs, so as to avoid false bidding of data publishers. A double auction game is then employed for data subscription, which balances the benefits between the USV fleet and the data subscriber. An incentive-based data sharing algorithm is finally designed to obtain the optimal bidding strategies for all game parties including data publishers, USV fleets and data subscribers.

Such IoT applications continuously generate stream data with hidden values that need to unveiled in real time. Streaming analytics is emerging as a popular type of Big Data analytics to process large volume of stream data for IoT applications in remote regions. Built upon terrestrial-satellite integrated networks, Satellite Edge Computing (SEC) equipped with computing resource in satellites has been envisioning as a key enabling technology to timely analyze stream data of IoT applications in remote regions on the Earth. Considering the dynamically-moving property of satellites in an SEC network, it is vital to optimize the responsiveness of each Big Data analytical query, such that none of such queries takes much longer time to wait for available satellites with sufficient computing resource. Furthermore, the uncertain data volumes of Big Data queries in SEC networks make the resources in satellites fragmented, particularly when the collaboration among satellites is intermittent. Therefore, directly application of existing methods may not guarantee the timelineness of streaming analytics in an SEC network. To address the afore-mentioned unique challenges of streaming analytics in SEC networks, it is urgent to design new algorithms and methods for timely Big Data processing. Specifically, we use the flow time to capture the responsiveness of streaming analytics in satellite edge computing, which is the time between the generation of the first unit of a dataset and the finish time of the data processing. We consider the flow time minimization problem for query evaluation of Big Data analytics in an SEC network with the aim of minimizing the average flow time of Big Data analytical queries, under an assumption of uncertain volumes of datasets. To this end, we first propose an approximation algorithm with a provable approximation ratio for the offline version of the flow time minimization problem. We then devise an online learning algorithm, referred to the customized Lipschitz bandit learning algorithm, with a bounded regret for the online version of the problem. We finally evaluate the performance of the proposed algorithms in a real SEC network topology. Experiment results show that the performance of the proposed algorithm outperforms its counterparts by at least 13% in terms of flow time.","1558-2183","","10.1109/TPDS.2023.3332333","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:62172068,62172071); Natural Science Foundation of Liaoning(grant numbers:2023-MS-111); City University of Hong Kong(grant numbers:9380137/CS,7005845); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10316604","Satellite edge computing;Big Data analytics;query evaluation;online learning;approximation algorithms","Satellites;Big Data;Minimization;Approximation algorithms;Servers;Collaboration;Internet of Things","","2","","69","IEEE","13 Nov 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Efficient execution and implementation of OPS are critical to meeting customer demands and reducing dissatisfaction, necessitating a thorough examination of the process of order picking features. The order picking, a cornerstone of warehouse operations, involves meticulous selection and gathering of items from designated storage locations, unfolding through stages like order assignment and order batching. In order assignment, specific orders are methodically delegated to pickers or teams, considering factors like urgency, order size, item location, and picker availability. The overarching goal is to optimize resource utilization and simultaneously reduce the time needed for order fulfillment, ensuring a streamlined and efficient approach. Conversely, order batching strategically groups multiple orders for concurrent picking, aiming to minimize trips and enhance overall efficiency and productivity. Throughout the order-picking process, pickers utilize tools like pick lists, barcode scanners, and automated storage and retrieval systems (AS/RS) for precise item location and retrieval. Post-collection, items are transported to a dedicated packing area for meticulous preparations before shipping to the customer. Orchestrating the order-picking process requires careful planning, coordination, and execution for punctual and precise customer order fulfillment. This paper highlighted a systematic reviewing process which analyzed relevant research papers, with a primary focus on the problems of order assignment and batching—a key area within the order-picking process.

Thus, ASV planners must identify long-term trajectories in order to avoid guiding the ASV into inevitable collision states. Furthermore, maritime vessels are required to follow COLlision REGulationS (COLREGS), which dictate collision avoidance patterns. Current state-of-the-art methods are based on model predictive control (MPC) and assume that other vessels move at constant velocities without the consideration of COLREGS. In this letter, we propose COLREG-RRT, an RRT-based planner capable of identifying long-term, COLREGS-compliant trajectories with a high navigation success rate. This is achieved by conducting joint forward simulations of both the ASV and the other vessels during RRT growth in order to anticipate future collisions. The COLREGS-compliance is enforced by constructing virtual obstacles that inhibit tree growth. We demonstrate COLREGS-compliance in single-ship encounters and compare against two state-of-the-art methods in multiship encounters with up to 20 other vessels. Experiments indicate that COLREG-RRT has a 32% higher success rate and is real-time capable in the most difficult environment tested. Additionally, COLREG-RRT identifies longer trajectories, as compared to MPC. This property aids with collision avoidance with other ships.","2377-3766","","10.1109/LRA.2018.2801881","National Science Foundation(grant numbers:IIS-1528047,IIS-1553266); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8281087","Motion and path planning;marine robotics","Marine vehicles;Navigation;Trajectory;Robots;Collision avoidance;Planning;Force","","90","","24","IEEE","8 Feb 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In this letter, we propose $\mathcal {L}_1$-NMPC, a novel hybrid adaptive NMPC to learn model uncertainties online and immediately compensate for them, drastically improving performance over the non-adaptive baseline with minimal computational overhead. Our proposed architecture generalizes to many different environments from which we evaluate wind, unknown payloads, and highly agile flight conditions. The proposed method demonstrates immense flexibility and robustness, with more than 90% tracking error reduction over non-adaptive NMPC under large unknown disturbances and without any gain tuning.

In conventional systems, the sorting shelves are fixed or are transported only after the completion of the sorting work of the shelves. Our new system transports the sorting shelf even if the sorting shelf is in the middle of sorting. This system improves the productivity of picking activity by transporting both the shelves to appropriate locations at the appropriate time. To handle complex transport tasks, the proposed system requires a real-time scheduling method. This study applies a real-time holonic scheduling method to resolve scheduling problems.

However, the traditional centralized learning approach (CL), which centralizes the data resources of different shipping companies to a cloud server for model training, is restricted in real industrial scenarios due to privacy concerns and business competitions. In this article, we propose a novel adaptive privacy-preserving federated learning approach, named AdaPFL, for fault diagnosis in IoS, which can organize different shipping agents to collaboratively develop a model by sharing model parameters with no risk of data leakage. First, we use two common tasks as examples to demonstrate that a small part of the model parameters might reveal the shipping agents’ raw information. Based on this, the Paillier-based communication scheme is designed to preserve the raw information of the shipping agents. Furthermore, to deal with the harsh marine environment, a control algorithm is proposed to adaptively change the model aggregation interval during the training process for reducing cryptography computation and communication costs.

External disturbances that depend on the operational environment such as maritime currents, wind, or rough terrain can affect the vehicle motion in a variety of ways. Furthermore, imperfections and simplifications of the vehicle model can also lead to unknown disturbances. One way to overcome this problem is by designing robust controllers to perform the task. Existing literature on MPF control does not consider these disturbances and further assume that the linear and angular velocity of the target frame is known. In this letter, these assumptions are relaxed through the design of robust MPF control schemes. To this end, two robust control strategies are proposed to solve the MPF control problem for a robotic vehicle with actuation constraints and bounded disturbances. Using Lyapunov-based arguments, both controllers are proven to be globally asymptotically stable with respect to the origin of the MPF error. Experimental results using autonomous underwater vehicles demonstrate the viability of the proposed control schemes for applications in a real world environment.","2377-3766","","10.1109/LRA.2019.2925733","European Union Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme MarineUAS under the Marie Sklodowska-Curie(grant numbers:642153); Projects(grant numbers:IMPROVE-POCI-01-0145-FEDER-031823,HARMONY-POCI-01-0145-FEDER-031411); FEDER(grant numbers:COMPETE2020-POCI); National funds (PIDDAC); Sabbatical Grant from FCT; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8750859","Marine robotics;robust control of robotic systems;motion control","Robots;Kinematics;Angular velocity;Motion control;Robust control;Vehicle dynamics;Disturbance observers","","28","","20","IEEE","28 Jun 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Because the comprehensive operational security of modern MTS is not yet mature, historical transportation data of the Maritime Silk Road are acquired and preprocessed. Afterward, DTs are introduced, and relay nodes are added to data transmission paths to construct a maritime transportation DTs model based on relay cooperation IoT. Eventually, this model’s security performance is validated through simulation experiments. Relay security analysis suggests that interference information is a vital guarantee to assist in information non-disclosure, from which the constructed model can harvest energy to increase the data transmission power, thereby improving communication performance and secrecy rate. Outage probability analysis reveals that the simulated and the theoretical results are almost the same; moreover, given the system’s multi-hop paths in the same environment, the more the relays and the greater the fading index, the better the system performance and the lower the outage probability. Once the iterations reach a particular number, the node secrecy rate becomes optimal and cannot cause excessive burden to the system; besides, the power distribution can establish a new equilibrium when the nodes are in different locations, so that system security performance gets improved. The simulated value is closest to the actual result under 100% successful transmission probability and  $0.01\sim 0.05~\lambda $  value. To sum up, the constructed maritime transportation DTs model presents extraordinary transmission and security performance, providing an experimental basis for intelligent and secure maritime transportation in the future.","1558-0016","","10.1109/TITS.2021.3122566","National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)(grant numbers:62171330,61873341,61902203); Key Research and Development Plan of Hubei Province(grant numbers:2020BAB102); Key and Development Plan—Major Scientific and Technological Innovation Projects of Shandong Province(grant numbers:2019JZZY020101); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9626558","Digital twins;maritime transportation system;Internet of Things;relay cooperation;maritime silk road","Transportation;Internet of Things;Marine vehicles;Sensors;Security;Relays;Radio frequency","","24","","32","IEEE","24 Nov 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

It considers the scenario where an Autonomous Surface Vehicle (ASV) acts as a Communication and Navigation Aid (CNA) to support Autonomous Underwater Vehicles (AUVs) with range measurements. As AUVs have no access to GPS while submerged, range measurements can bind the otherwise continuously growing navigational error. This can be done by methods such as range-only Extended Kalman Filter (EKF). In such methods, the resulting uncertainty and positional error depends on the geometry between transmitter (CNA) and receiver (AUV). This letter proposes a planning algorithm that combines priority based expansion of a search tree with random sampling-based exploration to position the CNA at strategic positions to transmit ranging messages at optimal times to reduce the uncertainty and error at the AUVs’ position.

The focus is on the smoothness of the estimated trajectory in environments where the GNSS observations become temporarily unreliable. Therefore, an inland shipping scenario with bridge crossings is selected as an application example. To estimate the trajectory in continuous-time, we integrate a White-Noise-On-Acceleration (WNOA) motion prior factor based on Gaussian process regression between successive states.

In addition to machines and work-in-process buffers usually considered in current literature, a finished goods buffer is added to the manufacturing system to store the final products. For a fixed shipping period, a certain amount of products are shipped to the customers. For these systems, the production process and inventory level may fluctuate when goods are shipped. As a result, they are in dynamic modes in part or all the processing cycles, and an unacceptable error occurs when employing the steady-state analysis algorithm. Therefore, this article develops effective algorithms for analyzing the dynamic behavior in manufacturing systems with regular orders. Specifically, the system with one machine and finished goods buffer isolated from the manufacturing system is first modeled and estimated. Then, based on it, we proposed an aggregation method, which can be employed in larger systems.

For these reasons, this contribution presents the Seaport Data Space (SDS) based on the Industrial Data Space (IDS) reference architecture model to enable a secure data sharing space and promote an intelligent transport multimodal terminal. Each seaport stakeholders implements the IDS connector to take part in the SDS and share their data. On top of SDS, a Big Data architecture is integrated to manage the massive data shared in the SDS and extract useful information to improve the decision-making. The architecture has been evaluated by enabling a port authority and a container terminal to share its data with a shipping company. As a result, several Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) have been developed by using the Big Data architecture functionalities.

With the predicted channel quality, we construct an integrated optimization problem for the co-design of communication and flocking strategies. Along with this, a value iteration-based RL flocking controller is developed to achieve the co-design of channel estimation and flocking control for AUVs. It is worth mentioning that, the value iteration-based RL estimator in this paper can avoid local optimal in traditional least-squares methods, and meanwhile the flocking controller in this paper can make a balance between flocking stability and communication efficiency for AUVs. Finally, simulation and experimental results reveal that the proposed approach in this paper has superior performances by comparing with the other works. As such, our approach is more useful for marine engineer to understand and explore the maritime transportation system from the communication and control view points.","1558-0016","","10.1109/TITS.2023.3292967","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:62222314,61973263,62033011); Youth Talent Program of Hebei(grant numbers:BJ2020031); Distinguished Young Foundation of Hebei Province(grant numbers:F2022203001); Excellent Youth Project for NSF of Hebei Province(grant numbers:F2021203056); Central Guidance Local Foundation of Hebei Province(grant numbers:226Z3201G); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10184915","Communication-aware;flocking;reinforcement learning;autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs)","Channel estimation;Vehicle dynamics;Transportation;Mathematical models;Underwater acoustics;Force;Fading channels","","4","","51","IEEE","17 Jul 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

However, the resources-constrained maritime users cannot meet the high requirements of transmission delay and energy consumption, due to the excessive traffic and limited resources in maritime networks. To solve this problem, mobile edge computing is taken as a promising paradigm to help mobile devices from edge servers via computation offloading considering the different quality of service (QoS) with the complex ocean environments, resulting in energy saving and increased transmission latency. To investigate the tradeoff between latency and energy consumption in low-cost large-scale maritime communication, we formulate the offloading optimization problem and propose a two-stage joint optimal offloading algorithm, optimizing computation and communication resource allocation under limited energy and sensitive latency. At the first stage, the maritime users make the decision on whether to offload a computation considering their demands and environments. Then, the channel allocation and power allocation problems were proposed to optimize the offloading policy which coordinates with the center cloud servers at the second stage, considering the dynamic tradeoff of latency and energy consumption. Finally, numerical simulation results show the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.","2327-4662","","10.1109/JIOT.2019.2958662","Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61771086); Dalian Outstanding Young Science and Technology Talents Foundation(grant numbers:2017RJ06); Liaoning Province Xingliao Talents Program(grant numbers:XLYC1807149); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8930514","Energy???latency tradeoff;maritime Internet of Things (M-IoT);mobile edge computing (MEC);offloading strategies","Marine vehicles;Servers;Task analysis;Cloud computing;Resource management;Internet of Things;Oceans","","91","","41","IEEE","10 Dec 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Cutting greenhouse gases (GHG) emissions and decarbonizing the international shipping has been a paramount activity for the International Maritime Organization (IMO) since the first set of international mandatory measures to improve ships' energy efficiency and reduce CO2 emissions per transport work, as part of the International Convention for the Prevention of Pollution from Ships (MARPOL) released in 2011. Besides that, changes in consumption habits around the globe (i.e., digitalization and growth of e-commerce) plus disruptive events like the COVID-19 or the blocking of the Suez Canal, to name only a few, have also highlighted the need for building more resilient maritime transport networks. In this work, a pragmatical analysis of the principal machine learning algorithms has been carried out to provide a qualitative prediction of the Estimate Time of Arrival (ETA) of container vessels applied to short-sea shipping where the distance between ports is reduced. By exploiting both, the Automatic Identification System (AIS) and meteorological data gathered over a desired area of interest, the developed approach delivers a model capable of predicting the ETA of ships where the reaction time of the stakeholders involved in the management of the Port Call is very reduced (i.e., less than two hours of sailing between ports) and therefore, tolerance for error is low. Very positive results were obtained for the training dataset collected under real conditions for more than a year. The best results were obtained by the RF model with a Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) of 11.31 and 19.56 minutes respectively.","1548-0992","","10.1109/TLA.2022.9904760","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9904760","Maritime Logistics;Automatic Identification System;Estimated Time of Arrival;Machine Learning;Short-Sea Shipping;Green Transition;Decarbonization","Random forests;Artificial intelligence;Regression tree analysis;Marine vehicles;Support vector machines;Radio frequency;Containers","","6","","","IEEE","28 Sep 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Since the modes of freight transport differ substantially, the purpose of this article is to compare the contextual differences among IoT adoption drivers in road, rail, and maritime freight transport and assess the suitability of different modes of freight transport for IoT adoption. The identified drivers for IoT adoption are classified under the technology, organization, and environmental framework, and the relative weight of drivers for road, rail, and maritime freight transport are compared using fuzzy analytic network process method. The most important drivers for freight transport are competitive advantage, management support (MGS), and security and privacy. Comparatively, the most prioritized driver for road transport is investment cost, for rail transport is MGS, and for maritime is the ease of use. This article found the maritime transport as the best mode to adopt IoT using multiobjective optimization on the basis of a ratio analysis plus the full multiplicative form method.

In maritime IoT, the spatio-temporal vessel trajectories, collected from the hybrid satellite-terrestrial automatic identification system (AIS) base stations, are of considerable importance for promoting traffic situation awareness and vessel traffic services, etc. To guarantee traffic safety and efficiency, it is essential to robustly and accurately predict the AIS-based vessel trajectories (i.e., the future positions of vessels) in maritime IoT. In this work, we propose a spatio-temporal multigraph convolutional network (STMGCN)-based trajectory prediction framework using the mobile edge computing (MEC) paradigm. Our STMGCN is mainly composed of three different graphs, which are, respectively, reconstructed according to the social force, the time to closest point of approach, and the size of surrounding vessels. These three graphs are then jointly embedded into the prediction framework by introducing the spatio-temporal multigraph convolutional layer. To further enhance the prediction performance, the self-attention temporal convolutional layer is proposed to further optimize STMGCN with fewer parameters. Owing to the high interpretability and powerful learning ability, STMGCN is able to achieve superior prediction performance in terms of both accuracy and robustness. The reliable prediction results are potentially beneficial for traffic safety management and intelligent vehicle navigation in MEC-enabled maritime IoT.","1941-0050","","10.1109/TII.2022.3165886","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:52171351,SUTD SRG-ISTD-2021-165); SUTD-ZJU IDEA(grant numbers:SUTD-ZJU (VP) 202102); SUTD-ZJU IDEA Seed Grant(grant numbers:SUTD-ZJU (SD) 202101); National Research Foundation Singapore(grant numbers:AISG2-RP-2020-019); RIE 2020 Advanced Manufacturing and Engineering(grant numbers:A20G8b0102); Nanyang Assistant Professorship; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9754225","Automatic identification system (AIS);graph convolutional network (GCN);maritime Internet of Things (IoT);mobile edge computing (MEC);trajectory prediction","Trajectory;Artificial intelligence;Task analysis;Predictive models;Internet of Things;Load modeling;Kinematics","","78","","43","IEEE","8 Apr 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

However, most drivers do not have access to such systems. The required monitoring platform would have to deliver the required performance while also being affordable and accessible. A candidate with considerable promise is the smartphone with sensors built-in that could be exploited for the detection of driving events. However, to date it has not been possible to achieve the required correct, missed and false detection rates in addition to the computational efficiency for real-time operations. This paper proposes a novel bagging tree and dynamic time warping (DTW) integrated algorithm for the detection of driving events employing acceleration and orientation data from a smartphone's low cost three-axis accelerometers and gyroscopes. The bagging tree-based machine learning algorithm provides the initial maneuver detection results, as well as the location of the event start and end points. Event detection is then achieved by calculating the similarity of the results predicted through the bagging tree algorithm with the corresponding templates extracted from the experience datasets, while also applying a number of constraints to verify the calculated results. Field test results show that the proposed integrated algorithm is superior to the state-of-the-art, achieving a high correct detection accuracy of 97.5%, a low missed detection of 2.5% and a false detection rate of 2.9%. The corresponding results for the best alternative candidate method are 90.2%, 9.8% and 11.7%.

The latter is a classical search pattern suggested by the international aeronautical and maritime search and rescue (IAMSAR) manual. To program the reference signals for the USV-UAVs simultaneously, the reference routes are programmed that uses a virtual ship and a virtual aerial. Therein, the information of the virtual aerials can be mapped from a virtual ship. Further, the desired attitude angles are derived under the cooperative virtual guidance framework. For a control part, a novel threshold rule of the dynamic event-triggered mechanism is reconstructed according to output errors to avoid the artificial parameter tuning and reduce the data transmission load from the controllers to the actuators.

The proposed scheme is comprised of two parts, i.e., the three-dimensional (3D) search guidance principle and the cooperative formation control law. The developed guidance principle can generate the reference signals for the USV and UAVs, which the maneuvering characteristics of the heterogeneous agents are considered at the waypoints. Linked with the guidance term, a robust adaptive event-triggered control algorithm is designed for the cooperative system by fusing the dynamic event-triggered mechanism and sensor-tolerant technique. The dynamic triggered threshold is constructed on basis of the state error rather than the predefined parameters. Besides, the constrains of the sensor faults and the model uncertainties are tackled by constructing the adaptive parameter and robust neural damping term. Through the Lyapunov theorem, the semi-global uniform ultimate bounded (SGUUB) stability is guaranteed for all state variables.

To date, these vulnerabilities are considered critical and the consequences of their disclosure far-reaching. The vulnerabilities potentially affect a wide range of internet of things (IoT) devices, embedded devices, critical infrastructure (CI), and cyber-physical systems (CPSs).

For our experiments, we employ software-defined radios (SDRs), use open-source software, develop novel tools, and develop features to existing software. We evaluate the feasibility of the attacks and demonstrate end-to-end RCE with all three studied protocols.

Towards this end, integrating unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) in sixth generation (6G) MCN topologies results in the formation of an aerial segment, complementing shore base stations that may offer insufficient coverage, and satellite communication, characterized by increased delays. In this study, we focus on an MCN where the direct links towards a shore BS are not available, due to excessive fading conditions. For this case, we use a UAV swarm to provide improved wireless connectivity, adopting non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) for high resource efficiency. In downlink communication, UAVs take into consideration the desired service rate and the channel quality of their links towards the maritime nodes. In the uplink, UAVs employ dynamic decoding ordering to enhance the performance of successive interference cancellation, avoiding fixed ordering of the maritime nodes’ signals. Moreover, to ensure highly flexible UAV selection, UAVs are equipped with buffers to store data. Performance comparisons show that the UAV swarm-aided MCN enjoys increased average sum-rate by relying on multi-criteria-based interference cancellation and buffer-aided UAVs, over other benchmark schemes in the downlink and uplink.

These ground-breaking techniques have promoted the rapid development of Internet of Things (IoT) in maritime industries. In maritime IoT applications, intelligent vessel traffic services can be guaranteed by collecting and analyzing high volume of spatial data flows from automatic identification system (AIS). This AIS system includes a highly integrated automatic equipment, including functionalities of core communication, tracking, and sensing. The increased utilization of shipboard AIS devices allows the collection of massive trajectory data. However, the received raw AIS data often suffers from undesirable outliers (i.e., poorly tracked timestamped points for vessel trajectories) during signal acquisition and analog-to-digital conversion. The degraded AIS data will bring negative effects on vessel traffic services (e.g., maritime traffic monitoring, intelligent maritime navigation, vessel collision avoidance, etc.) in maritime IoT scenarios. To improve the quality of vessel trajectory records from AIS networks, we propose to develop a two-phase data-driven machine learning framework for vessel trajectory reconstruction. In particular, a density-based clustering method is introduced in the first phase to automatically recognize the undesirable outliers. The second phase proposes a bidirectional long short-term memory (BLSTM)-based supervised learning technique to restore the timestamped points degraded by random outliers in vessel trajectories. Comprehensive experiments on simulated and realistic data sets have verified the dominance of our two-phase vessel reconstruction framework compared to other competing methods. It thus has the capacity of promoting intelligent vessel traffic services in 6G-enabled maritime IoT systems.","2327-4662","","10.1109/JIOT.2020.3028743","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:51609195,62071343); Open Research Project of the State Key Laboratory of Industrial Control Technology, Zhejiang University, China(grant numbers:ICT20044); Deanship of Scientific Research at King Saud University, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, for funding this work through the Vice Deanship of Scientific Research Chairs: Chair of Smart Technologies; Alibaba Group through Alibaba Innovative Research Program; Alibaba- NTU Singapore Joint Research Institute, Nanyang Technological University, Singapore; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9212417","6G wireless systems;automatic identification system (AIS);maritime Internet of Things (IoT);neural networks;vessel traffic services","Trajectory;Internet of Things;Artificial intelligence;6G mobile communication;5G mobile communication;Monitoring;Navigation","","128","","44","IEEE","5 Oct 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

To tackle this problem, we establish a nearshore network by collaboratively using on-shore terrestrial base stations (TBSs) and tethered unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). These TBSs and UAVs form virtual clusters in a user-centric manner. Within each virtual cluster, non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) is adopted for agilely including various maritime IoT devices, which are sparsely distributed over the vast ocean. The nearshore network also shares the spectrum with marine satellites. In such a NOMA-based hybrid satellite-UAV-terrestrial network, interference among different network segments, different clusters, and different users occurs. We thereby formulate a joint power allocation problem to maximize the sum rate of the network. Different from existing studies, we use large-scale channel state information (CSI) only for optimization to reduce system overhead. The large-scale CSI is obtained by using the position information of maritime IoT devices. The problem is non-convex with intractable non-linear constraints. We tackle these difficulties by adopting max-min optimization, the auxiliary function method, and the successive convex approximation technique. An iterative power allocation algorithm is accordingly proposed, which is shown to be effective for coverage enhancement by simulations.

This reflects the importance of maritime regions as well as the growing demand for more data and knowledge in these remote areas. Currently, the presence of information and communication technologies (ICTs) in offshore settings is limited by the lack of infrastructures, with communications being typically decoupled from the standard Internet or relying on expensive satellite solutions. This paper proposes integrating a commonly available maritime radio-technology, namely very high frequency (VHF) communications, with protocols used in the Internet of Things (IoT). By using the Internet Protocol version 6 (IPv6) over a low-power wireless personal area networks and the constrained application protocol (CoAP), interoperability is ensured between already existing maritime systems and the Internet. An experimental setup is evaluated under different settings and using different configurations. In addition, an analytical assessment of the solutions’ reliability is presented. The obtained results prove the feasibility of using IoT protocols over a VHF link and demonstrate that such an approach outperforms IPv4-based solutions. The conducted assessment reveals that, in constrained settings, configurations at the application layer (e.g., CoAP’s block size in Block-wise transfers) strongly impact the overall performance and reliability of the system. This motivates the development of new maritime solutions based on IPv6 for ensuring a sustainable and ubiquitous development of ICTs even in the most remote locations.","2327-4662","","10.1109/JIOT.2018.2868439","H2020 Marie Skłodowska-Curie Actions(grant numbers:699924–SINet); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8453795","Computer network reliability;Internet of Things (IoT);Internet Protocol version 6 (IPv6) over a low-power wireless personal area networks (6LoWPANs);IP fragmentation;IP networks;maritime communication;very high frequency (VHF) devices","Protocols;Internet of Things;IP networks;Wireless personal area networks;Personal area networks;Low-power electronics","","31","","45","CCBY","2 Sep 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

However, the maritime traffic data in MTS cannot be effectively processed in traditional big data analysis methods, and the integrity of it needs to be checked before being used to achieve the prediction of trajectories and high-density areas of vessels. In this paper, we propose a flexible data integrity checking scheme with original data recovery in IoT-enabled MTS. In the proposed scheme, the data blocks of vessels are encoded based on the technology of erasure coding. To ensure the availability of the historical data, the existence and the integrity of the data elements stored in the cloud can be checked. Moreover, the original data blocks can be recovered efficiently if the encoded data elements have been corrupted or deleted. Security analysis demonstrates that the proposed scheme can be proved to be correct and is secure against malicious attacks. Performance analysis shows that our scheme is more efficient than the previous schemes.","1558-0016","","10.1109/TITS.2021.3125070","National Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:62102169); Natural Science Foundation of the Jiangsu Higher Education Institutions of China(grant numbers:21KJB520033); Research Start-up Fund of Jiangsu Ocean University (JOU)(grant numbers:KQ20039); Six Talent Peaks Project in Jiangsu Province(grant numbers:XYDXX-140); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9609639","Internet of Things;maritime transportation systems;integrity checking;data recovery","Cloud computing;Data integrity;Security;Memory;Internet of Things;Trajectory;Real-time systems","","25","","43","IEEE","9 Nov 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In order to meet the huge demand for wireless communications in maritime environment, mobile edge computing (MEC) is considered as an effective solution to provide powerful computing capabilities for maritime terminals of resource scarcity or latency sensitive. A basic technology to implement MEC is virtual machine (VM) multiplexing, through which multi-task parallel computing on a server is realized. In this paper, a two-layer unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) maritime communication network with a centralized top-UAV (T-UAV) and a group of distributed bottom-UAVs (B-UAVs) is established and MEC is used on T-UAV. We aim to solve the latency minimization problem for both communication and computation in this maritime UAV swarm mobile edge computing network. We reformulate this problem into a Markov decision process (MDP), since it is a non-convex and multiply constrained but has the characteristics of MDP. Based on this MDP model, we take deep reinforcement learning (DRL) as our tool to propose a deep Q-network (DQN) and a deep deterministic policy gradient (DDPG) algorithms to optimize the trajectory of T-UAV and configuration of virtual machines (VMs). Using these two proposed algorithms, we can minimize the system latency.

Machine learning has been applied in the past to the sEMG signal (not in the clinical setting) with interesting results, which provide more insight on how these data could be used to improve prosthetic functionality. Researchers have mainly concentrated so far on increasing the accuracy of sEMG classification and/or regression, but, in general, a finer control implies a longer training period. A desirable characteristic would be to shorten the time needed by a patient to learn how to use the prosthesis. To this aim, we propose here a general method to reuse past experience, in the form of models synthesized from previous subjects, to boost the adaptivity of the prosthesis. Extensive tests on databases recorded from healthy subjects in controlled and noncontrolled conditions reveal that the method significantly improves the results over the baseline nonadaptive case.

In order to guarantee the satisfactory performance of the USV operating in a calm environment, a baseline state feedback tracking controller considering the characteristics of yaw rate and rudder operations, and USV steering and actuator dynamics is first designed. In the presence of time-varying environmental disturbances, a retrofit adaptive disturbance compensating control mechanism is then developed based on the disturbance amplitude estimated from an indirect adaptive disturbance estimator. Finally, a reconfigurable adaptive path following controller is synthesized by combining the baseline controller and the adaptive disturbance compensating mechanism for the proper operation of the USV in the presence of environmental disturbances, while the desired path is successfully followed by the USV within an acceptable deviation boundary and without violating constraints of turning rates as well as amplitude and rate of rudder deflections.

By automatic initializing KCF on a target in different time steps and fusing these multiple KCFs via the maximum likelihood, the proposed tracker implicitly uses multiple instances of the target to improve the robustness of the long-term tracking. Bounding rectangles of the multiple trackers also enhance the reliability of ship segmentation via a voting procedure. In the real ship tracking experiment, the proposed tracker performs favorably against the conventional radar tracker and top-ranked visual tracker in the cases of clutter interruption, ship occlusions, and scale changing.

Mobile edge computing driven by powerful computing capability and edge intelligence is taken as a promising solution, especially for the resource-constrained and delay-sensitive maritime IoT users. In this paper, we study the optimal edge server selection problem for ship IoT users to jointly minimize the latency and energy consumption for task offloading. Specifically, we first propose a novel space-air-ground-edge (SAGE) integrated maritime network architecture to offload computation-intensive IoT services at sea. Then, the latency and energy consumption of data transmission and processing during offloading are modelled. Based on the models, the edge server selection problem is formulated into a Multi-Armed Bandits learning problem, with considering the task latency requirement and energy budget. To achieve the optimal solution, a novel algorithm, referred to as UCB1-ESSS, is developed, which links the latency, energy consumption, and network constraints by introducing both reward and cost. The simulation results show that the proposed algorithm can achieve considerably lower offloading latency and weighted latency-energy cost compared with the traditional algorithms under different QoS requirements, which proves the efficacy of theproposed algorithm.","1939-9359","","10.1109/TVT.2022.3141740","National Defense Foundation Strengthening Plan(grant numbers:2020-JCJQ-ZD-020-05); National Defense Technology Innovation Research Institute(grant numbers:2020KCYWXGK4098); Liaoning Province(grant numbers:XLYC1807149); National Key Research and Development Program of China(grant numbers:2020YFB1806800); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9677894","Computing offloading;edge intelligence;maritime wireless networks;multi-armed bandits;marine ship IoT users","Servers;Internet of Things;Marine vehicles;Task analysis;Energy consumption;Delays;Computational modeling","","20","","42","IEEE","11 Jan 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

It is of great significance to build a secure and efficient maritime transportation system (MTS). The introduction of Internet of things technology makes MTS more perfect. The IoT-enabled MTS is composed of marine terminals and on-board sensors, land-based data centers and base stations, as well as satellite networks. Many researchers have carried out significant work to aggregate data in MTS. However, because the terrestrial base stations cannot cover most of the sea area, the isolated maritime terminals, those who drive to the area without base station coverage, need the assistance of satellite networks to complete the contact with the data center. In this paper, we propose an attribute based secure data aggregation scheme for isolated IoT-enabled MTS. In the novel scheme, the constant attributes of a maritime terminal are utilized to generate its certification. In addition, on-board sensors are introduced in the system to help aggregate the status and surrounding environment of the maritime terminal. These monitoring data are encrypted by the sensors and transmitted to the data center for the trustworthiness evaluation of the isolated maritime terminal.

Due to the emergence of global trends and disruptions, MCS firms increasingly face an uncertain environment. Consequently, MCS firms must develop dynamic capabilities to enable the reconfiguration of organizational resources for building resilience in a constantly changing business ecosystem. To create adequate dynamic capabilities, MCS firms need to anticipate the future of their macro environment through advanced foresight techniques. Using a Delphi-based scenario analysis, this study systematically examines scenarios for MCS firms’ macro environment. Twelve projections for the MCS industry were systematically created and were then assessed by 51 maritime experts. The resulting three distinct scenarios deliver valuable insights for MCS firms’ executives, whereas the blockchains and drones technology will have already increased efficiency in the short-term scenario “picking the low-hanging fruit,” other technological disruptions will only affect the industry in the medium-term scenario “experiencing an era of dichotomy.” In the long-term scenario “overcoming the obstacles of the generational shift,” MCS firms will experience a transfer toward alternative fuel powered and autonomously driven vessels. Offering detailed scenarios for the future MCS macro environment, this study represents a guide for decision-makers on how to create dynamic capabilities in MCS firms to build resilience. Moreover, the results revealed differences in the experts’ assessments due to their characteristics. Therefore, the study contributes to the academic focus on in-depth diversity analysis in the Delphi methodology and emphasizes the relevance of incorporating multiple stakeholders and panelists in future planning.","1558-0040","","10.1109/TEM.2021.3137009","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9714458","COVID-19;Delphi;freight transportation;judgmental forecasting;maritime;scenarios;technology foresight","Containers;Supply chains;COVID-19;Uncertainty;Planning;Pandemics;Industries;Bibliographies","","14","","286","IEEE","16 Feb 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Recently, methods based on deep learning have been successfully applied to ship detection for SAR images. Despite the development of numerous ship detection methodologies, detecting small and coastal ships remains a significant challenge due to the limited features and clutter in coastal environments. For that, a novel adaptive multi-hierarchical attention module (AMAM) is proposed to learn multi-scale features and adaptively aggregate salient features from various feature layers, even in complex environments. Specifically, we first fuse information from adjacent feature layers to enhance the detection of smaller targets, thereby achieving multi-scale feature enhancement. Then, to filter out the adverse effects of complex backgrounds, we dissect the previously fused multi-level features on the channel, individually excavate the salient regions, and adaptively amalgamate features originating from different channels. Thirdly, we present a novel adaptive multi-hierarchical attention network (AMANet) by embedding the AMAM between the backbone and the feature pyramid network (FPN). Besides, the AMAM can be readily inserted between different frameworks to improve object detection. Lastly, extensive experiments on two large-scale SAR ship detection datasets, namely the SSDD and HRSID, demonstrate that our AMANet method achieves superior performance over state-of-the-art methods, with an AP of 74.20% and 68.90% on the SSDD and HRSID datasets, respectively.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2024.3436591","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:62171467); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10620176","SAR ship detection;adaptive multi-hierarchical attention;deep learning","Marine vehicles;Feature extraction;Radar polarimetry;Sea measurements;Adaptation models;Accuracy;Clutter;Deep learning;Synthetic aperture radar","","","","96","CCBYNCND","1 Aug 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Crowdsourcing as a newly distributed problem-solving paradigm could provide new solutions for conducting maritime big data computing, deep learning and sensing tasks by leveraging the crowd intelligence and computing power of vessels, but strong incentives are required to stimulate vessels to participate because of their selfishness and rationality.

Current maritime communication networks (MCNs) mainly rely on marine satellites and on-shore base stations (BSs). The former generally provides limited transmission rate, while the latter lacks wide-area coverage capability. Due to these facts, the state-of-the-art MCN falls far behind terrestrial fifth-generation (5G) networks. To fill up the gap in the coming sixth-generation (6G) era, we explore the benefit of deployable BSs for maritime coverage enhancement. Both unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) and mobile vessels are used to configure deployable BSs. This leads to a hierarchical satellite-UAV-terrestrial network on the ocean. We address the joint link scheduling and rate adaptation problem for this hybrid network, to minimize the total energy consumption with quality of service (QoS) guarantees. Different from previous studies, we use only the large-scale channel state information (CSI), which is location-dependent and thus can be predicted through the position information of each UAV/vessel based on its specific trajectory/shipping lane. The problem is shown to be an NP-hard mixed integer nonlinear programming problem with a group of hidden non-linear equality constraints. We solve it suboptimally by using Min-Max transformation and iterative problem relaxation, leading to a process-oriented joint link scheduling and rate adaptation scheme. As observed by simulations, the scheme can provide agile on-demand coverage for all users with much reduced system overhead and a polynomial computation complexity.

To promote smart traffic services in maritime IoT, it is necessary to accurately and robustly predict the spatiotemporal vessel trajectories. It is beneficial for collision avoidance, maritime surveillance, and abnormal behavior detection, etc. Motivated by the strong learning capacity of deep neural networks, this work proposes an AIS data-driven trajectory prediction framework, whose main component is a long short term memory (LSTM) network. In particular, the vessel traffic conflict situation modeling, generated using the dynamic AIS data and social force concept, is embedded into the LSTM network to guarantee high-accuracy vessel trajectory prediction. In addition, a mixed loss function is reconstructed to make our prediction results more reliable and robust in different navigation environments.

In order to meet the requirements of high bandwidth and low delay for the high-speed development of mobile network, and reduce the network load, the concept of mobile edge computing (MEC) is proposed and has been widely supported by the academia and industry. It is considered to be one of the key technologies of the next generation networks. Inspired by this idea, this paper introduces computing offloading technology to maritime mobile cloud networks. Maritime mobile cloud network is the product of the continuous development of cloud computing technology and mobile Internet technology. In this paper, we studied the issue of computation task offloading for vessel terminals, focusing on minimizing the energy consumption of vessel terminals and the execution delay of computation task. First, it determines that whether if it should be offloaded to the cloud server. Second, the server should be selected to run the computation task. The goal of the optimization is to minimize the energy consumption of vessel terminals and the execution delay of computation task taking into account of different weights. To reduce the execution latency and device energy consumption, we proposed a multivessel computation offloading algorithm based on improved Hungarian algorithm in maritime MEC network. Finally, simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed scheme.","2327-4662","","10.1109/JIOT.2018.2876151","International Association of Maritime Universities(grant numbers:FY2017); China Postdoctoral Science Foundation(grant numbers:2015T80238); National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61771086,61401057); Dalian Outstanding Young Science and Technology Talents Foundation; Natural Science Foundation of Liaoning Province(grant numbers:201602083); Science and Technology Research Program of Liaoning(grant numbers:L2014213); Dalian Science and Technology Project(grant numbers:2015A11GX018); Research Funds for the Central Universities(grant numbers:3132018144,01760325); Dalian High-Level Innovative Talent Project(grant numbers:2016RQ035); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8493152","Computation offloading;improved Hungarian algorithm;mobile edge computing (MEC)","Task analysis;Energy consumption;Delays;5G mobile communication;Cloud computing;Resource management;Marine vehicles","","57","","31","IEEE","16 Oct 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

However, there are still lots of challenges to solve until fully autonomous systems can be employed. Artificial Intelligence (AI) has played a major role in this paradigm shift and shows great potential for solving some of these challenges, such as the docking process of an autonomous vessel. This work proposes a lightweight volumetric Convolutional Neural Network (vCNN) capable of recognizing different docking-based structures using 3D data in real-time. A synthetic-to-real domain adaptation approach is also proposed to accelerate the training process of the vCNN. This approach makes it possible to greatly decrease the cost of data acquisition and the need for advanced computational resources. Extensive experiments demonstrate an accuracy of over 90% in the recognition of different docking structures, using low resolution sensors. The inference time of the system was about 120ms on average. Results obtained using a real Autonomous Surface Vehicle (ASV) demonstrated that the vCNN trained with the synthetic-to-real domain adaptation approach is suitable for maritime mobile robots. This novel AI recognition method, combined with the utilization of 3D data, contributes to an increased robustness of the docking process regarding environmental constraints, such as rain and fog, as well as insufficient lighting in nighttime operations.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3070694","European Regional Development Fund (ERDF) through the Operational Programme for Competitiveness and Internationalization—COMPETE 2020 Programme; National Funds through the Portuguese Funding Agency, Fundação para a Ciência e a Tecnologia (FCT)(grant numbers:POCI-01-0145-FEDER-030010); European Union’s Horizon 2020—The EU Framework Programme for Research and Innovation 2014–2020(grant numbers:871571); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9393874","Autonomous surface vehicle;docking;object recognition;point cloud","Three-dimensional displays;Object recognition;Robots;Training;Task analysis;Surface treatment;Real-time systems","","23","","30","CCBYNCND","2 Apr 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Traditional methods based on machine learning have made some achievements in detection tasks for specific objects. However, the ship objects are relatively small, and they are usually not accurately detected. In this article, we propose an electroencephalography (EEG)-based maritime object detection algorithm for IoT-driven surveillance systems in the smart ocean. For this purpose, we conduct experiments to record the EEG signals of subjects when they are watching the maritime image scenes. With the feature analysis of EEG signals, the event-related potential (ERP) components associated with detecting objects are induced, such as the  $P3$  and  $N2$  components. Employing classification based on linear discriminant analysis (LDA), the area under curve (AUC) of the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) is used to evaluate the detection accuracy. We use this novel method to determine and identify essential objects and areas from IoT devices, such as digital camera imaging sensors. Our proposed method can not only help to detect small objects accurately using fewer samples but can also be used to reduce the data volume needed to be stored and transmitted in IoT-driven marine surveillance systems.","2327-4662","","10.1109/JIOT.2020.2991025","National Key Research and Development Program of China(grant numbers:2018YFF0301205); National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:NSFC 61925105,61801260); Chinese Postdoctoral Science Foundation(grant numbers:2018T110098); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9079892","Electroencephalography (EEG);intelligent surveillance systems;Internet of Things (IoT);maritime object detection;smart ocean","Internet of Things;Object detection;Surveillance;Electroencephalography;Feature extraction;Oceans;Marine vehicles","","18","","38","IEEE","28 Apr 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Many critical waterways in the world are becoming more crowded due to many factors in waterway environments, such as invisibility, variability, and uncertainty. Accurate water depth information is necessary to improve navigation safety. Water depth information of electronic charts cannot be updated in a timely way, while the actual water depth is unpredictable, and this factor threatens the safety of vessels in waterway environments. Based on the shore-based network, ship navigation data and other big data can be integrated to vessels navigation environments in real time. In this paper, we present a new scheme to quickly and accurately construct a vessel safety navigation depth reference map, which contains appropriate channel water depth information. This effective scheme is based on automated identification system (AIS) data and increases the travel safety through crowded waterways. AIS data include rich maritime traffic information. Both the static and the dynamic information about vessels through waterways can be extracted and processed from big real-time AIS data. Based on extensive actual experiments, we apply data mining techniques to extract the waterway depth information both draft-depth and vessel trajectories based on AIS data. The data are collected from vessels in both locations: 1) the Nantong port, in Jiangsu Province, China and 2) Meizhou Bay waterway, in Fujian Province, China. The Hermite interpolation scheme is used to patch the trajectories of vessels, and the BP neural network model is introduced to predict the maximum vessel draft. Clustering and data fusion methods are employed to construct a vessel safety navigation depth reference map according to the cluster area of vessel trajectories and draft information. The experimental results demonstrate that the vessel safety navigation depth reference map accurately reflects the current water depth profile of channels. This paper can provide accurate and timely channel water-depth information for the vessel navigation and the maritime supervision. The proposed scheme in this paper can also provide reference for trajectory data processing and mining.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2018.2883421","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:51479157); Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities of China(grant numbers:WUT:2018ćó064GX); Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities of China(grant numbers:WUT:2018-zy-127); Hubei Key Laboratory of Inland Shipping Technology(grant numbers:NHHY2017001); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8546739","Big AIS Data;IoT;BP neural network;clustering and data fusion;navigation safety;vessel trajectory","Artificial intelligence;Navigation;Data mining;Marine vehicles;Trajectory;Safety;Real-time systems","","13","","28","OAPA","27 Nov 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The correlation matrices of the ambient noise spectrum levels offer a promising approach for identifying and isolating the active source mechanisms in ambient noise datasets. This study attempts to use frequency correlation matrices to examine inter-frequency relationships and identify frequency bands that are dominated by specific sources present in samples of ambient noise. Deep-ocean ambient noise recorded by hydroacoustic monitoring systems in the East China Sea and South China Sea was used to analyze the frequency correlation characteristics over a broadband frequency range, with a focus on the contribution of wind-related and shipping-related source mechanisms to the overall ambient noise field at various frequencies. The primary sources observed in both the South China Sea and East China Sea were shipping sources and wind sources. During the observation window, wind was responsible for a significant amount of the ambient noise energy above 477 Hz in the East China Sea, while the corresponding frequency threshold was shifted up to 575 Hz in the South China Sea. Another interesting feature was also observed in the East China Sea: a higher degree of correlation was found between the levels at the wind noise dominated frequencies and mixture noise (mainly consisting of wind noise and shipping noise) dominated frequencies at the upper receiver than at the lower receiver. Data analysis results show that the cause of this effect is that shipping activity contributes more to the soundscape at the lower receiver than at the upper receiver.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2019.2963331","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:11904290,11974286); China Postdoctoral Science Foundation(grant numbers:2018M643736); Chinese Academy of Sciences(grant numbers:SKLA201906); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8946553","Ambient noise;correlation matrices;wind-related noise;shipping-related noise","Correlation;Oceans;Receivers;Sea measurements;Spectrogram;Time-frequency analysis","","5","","38","CCBY","31 Dec 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Thus, the study aimed to evaluate the use of a nondestructive technology, equipment including a mechanical-portable sampler with a hardware device and sensors for real-time monitoring of temperature, relative humidity (RH), and intergranular carbon dioxide (CO2) to predict the quality of soybean in the function of different moisture contents (11%, 14%, and 18% w.b.), sampling positions in the grain mass profile, and shipping time (0, 60, 480, and 1440 min). The monitoring of indirect quality measurement variables associated with the application of machine-learning (ML) models satisfactorily predicted the physical quality of the grain mass, over the shipping time, for the different conditions tested. The moisture content associated with time was the factor with the greatest influence on the quality of transported grains. The shipping time is the determining factor for controlling the quality of grains. Lots of soybeans harvested from crops with moisture content between 14% and 18% must not exceed 120 min of shipping time to maintain quality. It is recommended that the shipping time of grains shipped from storage units to processing industries, with moisture contents between 11% and 14%, should not exceed 840 min. The M5P and reduced error pruning tree (REPTree) algorithms were the ones that best performed the prediction of grain quality. The monitoring system and grain quality prediction has application in grain-producing farms, grain storage, the grain-processing industry, and companies providing services in grain transport.

To further improve the efficiency of maritime data transmission between the UAVs and the maritime buoys, optical communication is considered as a promising technique because of its low latency and high bandwidth. However, optical communication encounters the challenge of beam pointing alignment, particularly in maritime data transmission involving wave disturbance and drift of buoy, which deteriorates and even interrupts the line-of-sight (LOS) optical transmission. To tackle the challenge, this article proposes DERLOC, a reliable data transmission solution based on deep reinforcement learning (DRL). We first provide the optimization analysis of reliable data transmission and formulate the data transmission procedure as a Markov decision process (MDP) aiming at maximizing the received signal intensity. Afterwards, we propose a beam pointing adjustment algorithm based on the soft actor-critic (SAC) approach to alleviate the performance deterioration caused by waves. Then, we analyze the drift characteristic of a buoy and develop a method which enables UAV to predict the position and determine an optimal movement control strategy for ensuring the effectiveness of beam pointing and maintaining stable LOS communication.

As container codes are the unique identifiers for shipping containers, recognizing these codes is an essential step to manage the containers and logistics. The conventional code localization methods can easily be interfered by varied noises and cannot identify the best regions for code recognition. In this article, we propose an adaptive deep learning framework for shipping container code localization and recognition. In the framework, the noisy text regions will be removed by an adaptive score aggregation (ASA) algorithm. The code region boundaries are identified by the average-to-maximum suppression range (AMSR) algorithm. Thus, the predicted locations can be adjusted within this range to fit the code recognition model to achieve higher accuracy. The experimental results on the comparative study with the state-of-the-art models, including EAST, PSENet, GCRNN, and MaskTextSpotter, demonstrated that the proposed framework achieved better localization performance and obtained 93.33% recognition accuracy. The processing speed reaches 1.13 frames/s, which is sufficient to meet the operational requirements. Thus, the proposed solution will facilitate the digital transformation of shipping container management and logistics at ports.","1557-9662","","10.1109/TIM.2020.3016108","Mitacs(grant numbers:IT12857); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9166730","Adaptive container code localization and recognition;convolutional neural network (CNN);deep learning;end-to-end text recognition;recurrent neural network (RNN);text detection","Containers;Feature extraction;Adaptation models;Noise measurement;Text recognition;Machine learning;Character recognition","","18","","35","IEEE","13 Aug 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Due to the unpredictable climate changes and the extreme channel conditions of maritime networks, however, it is challenging to efficiently and reliably collect and compute a huge amount of maritime data. In this article, we propose a hybrid low-Earth orbit (LEO) and unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) edge computing method in space–air–sea integrated networks for marine IoT systems. Specifically, two types of edge servers mounted on UAVs and LEO satellites are endowed with computational capabilities for the real-time utilization of a sizable data collected from ocean IoT sensors. Our system aims at minimizing the total energy consumption of the battery-constrained UAV by jointly optimizing the bit allocation of communication and computation along with the UAV path planning under latency, energy budget, and operational constraints. For availability and practicality, the proposed methods are developed for three different cases according to the accessibility of the LEO satellite, “Always On,” “Always Off,” and “Intermediate Disconnected,” by leveraging successive convex approximation (SCA) strategies. Via numerical results, we verify that significant energy savings can be accrued for all cases of LEO accessibility by means of joint optimization of bit allocation and UAV path planning compared to partial optimization schemes that design for only the bit allocation or trajectory of the UAV.","2327-4662","","10.1109/JIOT.2023.3287196","Institute of Information and Communications Technology Planning and Evaluation (IITP); Korea Government (MSIT) (Development of 3-D Spatial Satellite Communications Technology)(grant numbers:2021-0-00847); Ministry of Science and ICT (MSIT), Korea, under the Information Technology Research Center (ITRC) support program (Development of Communications and Computing Technology for Super-intelligent Services) supervised by the IITP(grant numbers:IITP-2020-0-01787); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10155303","Edge computing;Internet of Things (IoT);low-Earth orbit (LEO) satellite;marine networks;successive convex approximation (SCA);unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs)","Low earth orbit satellites;Satellites;Autonomous aerial vehicles;Internet of Things;Maritime communication;Sensors;Oceans;Edge computing;Climate change","","17","","39","IEEE","19 Jun 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The definition of actor (or stakeholder) roles and their interactions (at both business and technical levels), together with target scenarios and use cases, provide essential input information for further system requirement collection and architecture specification. The powerful and flexible Fifth Generation (5G) network slicing technology, which is capable of creating virtually isolated and logically parallel networks, enables a large range of complex services and vertical applications. Although various terminologies and models have been proposed in recent years for BMs in the 5G domain by many studies, projects, standards, and technical specifications from dedicated organizations, they are not always consistent with each other. This study presents an overview and comparison of different BMs for 5G sliced systems, followed by an example on BM definition for a 5G system in a novel ongoing European research project. While a general ecosystem and business model could involve a large range of organizations (including, e.g., regulation and standardization bodies), the scope of this article will be limited to primarily 5G operational BMs, with a focus on those actors or stakeholders who are active and interacting during real-life system operation.

However, UAV relaying introduces a significant security challenge due to the vulnerability of line-of-sight (LoS) communication channels, which can be exploited for eavesdropping on computing tasks. In this paper, an efficient secure communication scheme is proposed for UAV-relay-assisted maritime mobile edge computing (MEC) with a flying eavesdropper. The secure computing capacity of MDs is maximized by jointly optimizing the transmit power, time slot allocation factor, computation optimization and UAV trajectory. Due to multi-variable coupling, the formulated optimization problem (OP) is non-convex. We first transform OP by introducing auxiliary variables. Then, the transformed OP is decomposed and solved in an iterative manner by applying block coordinate descent (BCD) and successive convex approximation (SCA).

Then, the performances are evaluated given in terms of average data rate and outage probability in the hierarchical maritime radio networks. When evaluating the performances, heterogeneous channel characteristics of the hierarchical networks are taken into account in which Rayleigh fading is considered for the MUE-ship links, whereas shadowed-Rician fading is considered for the ship-DA links. Moreover, the effects due to various transmission errors that can be occurred at different communication layers are reflected in determining the quality of service (QoS) requirements of a ship.

First, we define threat models for DNS rebinding attacks. We employ a Markov chain to model the process of DNS rebinding attacks. With the threat modeling, the attack behaviors are clearly characterized and the most relevant attributes are thus extracted. Second, we propose an effective method for the detection of DNS rebinding attacks in the marine transportation system. The detection method includes the initialization method and the verification method, which manages and verifies access permission of equipment information and the service interface of the IoT in the shipborn network. Finally, we simulate the DNS rebinding attacks on the marine IoT. We analyze and test the security and the performance of the initialization method and the verification method in the simulated environment. The extensive experimental results demonstrate that the IoT in marine networks is vulnerable to DNS rebinding. Our method is effective and efficient to detect and defend against DNS rebinding attacks. It thus secures security and privacy in the local IoT on shipboard.","1558-0016","","10.1109/TITS.2021.3135197","National Key Research and Development Program of China(grant numbers:2020YFB2103802); Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities of China(grant numbers:2020JBZ104); Major Scientific and Technological Innovation Projects of Shandong Province, China(grant numbers:2019JZZY020128); Natural Science Foundation of Jiangsu Province(grant numbers:BK20191445); Natural Science Key Foundation of Jiangsu Education Department(grant numbers:21KJA510004); Qing Lan Project of Jiangsu Province; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9660780","IoT;DNS rebinding;maritime transportation;TTL;threat detection","Computer crime;Marine vehicles;Security;Local area networks;Internet of Things;Servers;Sensors","","8","","60","IEEE","22 Dec 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"
"Application of the Improved Chaotic Self-Adapting Monkey Algorithm Into Radar Systems of Internet of Things","Y. Cui","College of Electronics Engineering, Naval University of Engineering, Wuhan, China",IEEE Access,"15 Oct 2018","2018","6","","54270","54281","With the new applications of Internet of Things in recent years, radar sensors have become an important design unit in Internet of Things and embedded design. Considering that the dimensions of the radar sensors deployment problem increase with the increasing number of radars deployed and that the strength of the monkey algorithm is that it avoids the “dimension disaster,”this algorithm is introduced to solve the optimization problem. Some improvements are made based on the shortcomings of the traditional monkey algorithm. Adaptive climbing steps are used in the climbing process to enhance its local search capabilities, a tent function is used to balance the search accuracy and search time in the overlooking process and the jumping process, and a semi-group execution strategy is adopted for the above two processes. To improve the search accuracy, the learning factor and the Euclidean distance are introduced into the looping process, which improves the optimization ability and avoids the individual homoplasy. Therefore, the improved chaotic self-adapting monkey algorithm (ICSAMA) is proposed and abbreviated to ICSAMA. The simulation results show that the improved chaotic adaptive monkey algorithm is better than the monkey algorithm regarding the convergence precision and convergence rate. Finally, a mathematical model of radar deployment is established based on the volume of airspace coverage. Three simulation experiments are designed by using different conditions and scenarios, such as air defense, maritime combat, and trajectory planning, and an emphasis is placed on describing the applications of ICSAMA. The results show that ICSAMA can effectively solve the problem of radar deployment and provide technical support for the site selection of new observation and communication posts, deployment of maneuverable radar stations, and track planning of fleets.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2018.2869632","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61601492); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8463468","Internet of Things;radar system;monkey algorithm;chaos;adaptive;optimized deployment","Sensors;Radar;Cats;Convergence;Internet of Things;Optimization;Sociology","","5","","20","OAPA","12 Sep 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In particular, the Douglas-Peucker (DP) and kernel density estimation (KDE) algorithms, respectively, utilized for trajectory compression and visualization, were significantly accelerated through the massively parallel computation capabilities of the GPU architecture. Comprehensive experiments on trajectory compression and visualization have been conducted on large-scale AIS data of recording ship movements collected from three different water areas, i.e., the South Channel of Yangtze River Estuary, the Chengshan Jiao Promontory, and the Zhoushan Islands. Experimental results illustrated that: 1) the proposed GPU-based parallel implementation frameworks could significantly reduce the computational time for both trajectory compression and visualization; 2) the influence of compressed vessel trajectories on trajectory visualization could be negligible if the compression threshold was selected suitably; and 3) the Gaussian kernel was capable of generating more appropriate KDE-based visualization performance by comparing with other seven kernel functions.","2327-4662","","10.1109/JIOT.2020.2989398","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:51609195); Excellent Dissertation Cultivation Funds of Wuhan University of Technology(grant numbers:2018-YS-068); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9075295","Data visualization;graphics processing unit (GPU);parallel computing;trajectory compression;vessel trajectory","Trajectory;Data visualization;Graphics processing units;Internet of Things;Artificial intelligence;Industries;Acceleration","","85","","75","IEEE","21 Apr 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In the MTC, random access is introduced for devices to share a common access channel during the packet transmission with low signaling overhead. However, the collision caused by the presence of multiple devices is inevitable. Since maritime sensors have limited energy sources, in this article, we propose a relay-aided random access (RARA) scheme for the smart ocean, where retransmissions are carried out by maritime buoys with the relay function, to deal with collisions. In the RARA scheme, a base station (BS) is able to recover multiple collided signal packets simultaneously by using multiuser detection with multiple copies of collided signals forwarded by buoy nodes. As a result, our proposed scheme becomes energy efficient and reliable to be suitable for the smart ocean.

IoV is used for communication among vehicles in real-time with their drivers, other vehicles, pedestrians, fleet management systems, and roadside infrastructure. High vehicular speeds and frequent network topology changes make vehicle communication extremely difficult on the IoV network. More constraints are imposed on IoV communication performance in a huge network environment due to the difficult road conditions and the enormous quantity of vehicles. A promising approach to improve the IoV communication performance is through vehicle clustering. Minimizing the number of clusters and identifying a reliable Cluster head (CH) are some of the most challenging tasks. In this paper, we propose a Swarm optimization-based and mobility-aware clustering method termed SOMACA. SOMACA consists of two phases clustering phase and the routing phase. During the clustering phase, we combine mobility measures and cluster distance to generate the minimum number of clusters having stable CHs and employ the Sparrow Search algorithm (SSA) for CH selection. The routing phase consists of two steps (1) Route Formation and (2) Route Upkeep. The main target for route formation step is to build a secure routing path between IoV nodes and base station (BS) by establishing an optimal list of links that are ordered from high to low, and in each round, it selects the best one. Moreover, the Upkeep step aims to update and maintain the existing connection. The performance of SOMACA is assessed using simulation experiments with various metrics including average cluster lifetime, transmission range, and network grid size. The simulation results show that SOMACA reduces the average number of clusters by  $42\%, 48\%, 47\%, 9\%$ , 22%,31%, 16%, and 43% less than CAVDO, GOA, GWOCNET, MFCA-IOV, MOGA-AWCP, HHOCNET, AMONE, and p-WOA algorithms respectively when the transmission ranges vary between 200 and 500.

Specifically, a variational autoencoder is used to discover the potential connections between each dimension of the normal trajectory, while a graph variational autoencoder is used to explore the spatial similarity between normal trajectories. Based on internal connection of trajectories, a deep reinforcement learning algorithm, Twin Delayed Deep Deterministic policy gradient (TD3), is employed to train the trajectory anomaly detection model. To reduce the model training time, transfer learning is used to migrate the trained anomaly detection model between different regions of an ocean area or between similar ocean areas. Moreover, an efficient data transformation module is designed to improve the efficiency of model transfer.

To guarantee the transmission security of confidential data, an important alternative in an untrustworthy IoT-enabled MTS is to apply the covert timing channels. This paper mainly introduces the construction of covert timing channel with low bit shifting rate and high reliability by multi-stage verification and error correction. For the covert timing channel schemes realized by active packet loss, the packet loss noise interferes with the channel’s reliability. However, due to the constraints of stealthiness, the active packet loss ratio during covert communication is low, so more effective reliable strategies are needed to reduce noise interference. In the excellent scenario, when the bit error rate is lower than 0.08%, the transmission performance is kept at 0.49 bps. In the good scenario with strong network noise, although this method loses some performance, it can still maintain the transmission performance of 0.2 bps under the condition of bit error rate less than 1%, which effectively proves the effectiveness of multi-stage verification and error correction.","1558-0016","","10.1109/TITS.2021.3118853","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:62072037,U1936218,61876019); Fundamental Research Funds for Beijing Universities of Civil Engineering and Architecture(grant numbers:X20069); Research Fund of Beijing Information Science and Technology University(grant numbers:2021XJJ49); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9580492","Covert timing channel;IoT-enabled MTS;multi-stage verification;robustness","Packet loss;Timing;Interference;Robustness;Bit error rate;Industries;Error correction codes","","6","","46","IEEE","19 Oct 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The increasing growth of marine applications and services poses challenges for processing marine data, while the resources-limited UAVs cannot satisfy the requirements of computing-intensive and energy consumption. In this paper, we consider a marine edge computing scenario with a group of UAVs and ocean beacon stations (OBSs) and propose a multi-UAV aided multi-access edge computing for marine networks from the perspective of system-welfare and energy-efficient design. Specifically, we propose a multi-task multi-access offloading scheme in marine edge computing networks, in which multiple UAVs can process their workloads locally or offload their partial workloads to multiple OBSs for processing. We consider the total utilities for completing all tasks as the system welfare, and measure the difference between the system welfare and energy consumption as the system revenue. A joint optimization problem is formulated by optimizing the OBS selection, the offloading ratio and the transmission duration, with the objective of increasing the system revenue in marine edge computing networks. We exploit a vertical decomposition architecture to solve the formulated non-convex problem via decomposing it into three sub-problems. Regarding each sub-problem, we propose efficient algorithms to derive the optimal solutions. We finally conduct simulations to verify the performance of the proposed algorithms.

Utilizing unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) technology to facilitate the transfer of data from buoy sensor nodes, it becomes feasible to significantly reduce the latency generated in the transmission process. Therefore, we introduce a UAV-assisted maritime Internet of Things (MIoT) data collection mechanism based on relay cooperation. In this mechanism, through relay transmissions among UAVs, it avoids UAVs located distant from the shipboard station from having to traverse extensive distances in order to offload data to the shipboard station. Based on this, we propose a deep reinforcement learning-based cooperative data collection (DCDC) scheme. In this scheme, firstly, we select the convergence node in charge of forwarding the data from buoy sensor nodes to the passing UAVs. Next, to achieve dynamic adaptation of the task areas for UAVs, we propose an adaptive partition algorithm based on virtual moving points. Subsequently, to establish relay transmission links between UAVs, we present a routing algorithm based on matching game theory. Finally, to reduce time costs in delivering collected data to the shipboard station, we utilize a deep reinforcement learning algorithm based on multi-agent deep deterministic policy gradient (MADDPG) plan the flight paths of UAVs. Additionally, we introduce virtual waypoints in the path planning algorithm, which enables that paired UAVs can high-efficiently perform data forwarding through encounter opportunities.

Yet their tangled cyber-physical-social interactions and new emerging properties induce questions regarding their liability and trustworthiness. Digital simulations and sea trials are launched to assure the safety requirements and social expectations are met a priori. This paper presents the design of realistic testbed scenarios from huge historical data through a high-performance computational method to recommend a complete set of navigation scenarios for autonomy tests. The developed approach integrates traffic big data from Automatic Identification System (AIS) with high-resolution digital maps, vessel information registry, and digital nautical charts. All historical vessel-to-ground and vessel-to-vessel interactions are efficiently analyzed through a hierarchical method for collision and grounding conflicts assessment with a 15-minutes prediction horizon. Relative risk is evaluated accurately over full periods of predicted close-quarters situations subject to physical limits and sea-room availability for evasive maneuverers under COLREG rules and traffic separation schemes. Spatial dependencies among multiple conflicts define risky momentary traffic situations modelled through directed graph representation of nested interactions. Their temporal dependencies describe navigation scenarios through dynamic co-behaviors between multiple participating vessels over a period of time. Finally, we analyze negative/positive actions that increase/decrease the complexity. The presented algorithms are computationally very efficient, they scale to several (country*year)s where millions of scenarios are extracted, classified, and scored by their relative risk, complexity, and likelihood for firm post-test conclusions.","1558-0016","","10.1109/TITS.2021.3095547","Norwegian Research Council Research-Based Innovation Center BigInsight(grant numbers:237718); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9489382","AIS;collision risk prediction;COLREGs;complex navigation;digital nautical chart;grounding risk;maritime autonomous surface ship MASS;multiple conflicts;sea trials;testbed scenario;traffic big data;traffic separation schemes;vessel safety domain","Marine vehicles;Navigation;Safety;Complexity theory;Collision avoidance;Seaports;Radar tracking;Autonomous vehicles;Big Data;Traffic control","","23","","50","IEEE","16 Jul 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The applications of ubiquitous IoTs have been extended to Maritime Transportation Systems (MTS) that spawned increasing security threats; posing serious fiscal concerns to stakeholders involved. Among these threats, Distributed Denial of Service Attack (DDoS) is ranked very high that can wreak havoc on IoT artifacts of the MTS networks. Timely and effective detection of such attacks is imperative for necessary mitigation. Conventional approaches exploit entropy of attributes in network traffic for detecting DDoS attacks. However, the majority of these approaches are static in nature and consider only a few network traffic parameters, limiting the number of DDoS attack detection to a few types and intensities. In current research, a novel framework named “Dual Stack Machine Learning (S2ML)” has been proposed to calculate distinct entropy-based varying 10-Tuple (T) features from network traffic features, three window sizes and associated Rate of Exponent Separation (RES). These features have been exploited for developing an intelligent model over MTS-IoT datasets to successfully detect multiple types of DDoS attacks in MTS. S2ML is an efficient framework that overcomes the shortcomings of prevalent DDoS detection approaches, as evident from the comparison with Multi-layer Perceptron (MLP), Alternating Decision Tree (ADT) and Simple Logistic Regression (SLR) over different evaluation metrics (Confusion metrics, ROCs). The proposed S2ML technique outperforms prevalent ones with 1.5% better results compared to asserted approaches on distribution of normal/attack traffic.

Cloud computing, a major paradigm shift for the IT industry, threatens that leadership position. Cloud computing drives the value chain increasingly toward systems software and services. It has a major negative impact on the already marginal profit picture that threatens Taiwan's hardware manufacturing industry, and the Taiwan economy as a whole. The Institute for Information Industry (III) has devised a strategy and technology called cloud appliances for enterprises (CAFÉ) to address the effects of this technology shift. CAFÉ is a major initiative to help traditional Taiwanese OEM/ODM vendors transform themselves from primarily being commodity hardware providers into highly profitable, full-function cloud systems business that can reach worldwide markets. The III develops key system software components (CAFÉ technology components) that can be integrated with partners' hardware and other technology to create appliances that deliver cloud infrastructure and services enabling enterprises to establish private clouds (thus the name CAFÉ). Appliances that offer user-ready services and applications, provide significantly higher value to customers, support higher prices than hardware alone, and thereby increase the profit margin of Taiwanese IT vendors. Key Taiwan hardware vendors that have already adapted the CAFÉ strategy include ASUS, Delta Electronics, GIGABYTE, In Win, and Promise Technology. They are developing, integrating, and shipping cloud appliances that incorporate CAFÉ technology components, as well as their own technology. The CAFÉ strategy has turned the cloud computing challenge into a golden opportunity, moving the IT industry of Taiwan toward the next horizon.

This article combines ocean research with the IoT, in order to investigate the wave height prediction to assist ships to improve the economy and safety of maritime transportation and proposes an ocean IoT Green Ocean of Things (GOoT) with a green and low-carbon concept. In the wave height prediction, we apply a hybrid model (EMD-TCN) combining the temporal convolutional network (TCN) and the empirical mode decomposition (EMD) to the buoy observation data. We then compare it with TCN, long short-term memory (LSTM), and hybrid model EMD-LSTM. By testing the data of eight selected NDBC buoys distributed in different sea areas, the effectiveness of the EMD-TCN hybrid model in wave height prediction is verified. The hysteresis problem in previous wave height prediction research is eliminated, while improving the accuracy of the wave height prediction. In the 24 h, 36 h, and 48 h wave height prediction, the minimum mean absolute errors are 0.1265, 0.1689, and 0.1963, respectively; the maximum coefficient of determination are 0.9388, 0.9019, and 0.8712, respectively. In addition, in the short-term prediction, the EMD-TCN hybrid model also performs well, and has strong versatility.","2691-4581","","10.1109/TAI.2022.3168246","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61902203); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9760168","Empirical mode decomposition (EMD);Internet of Things (IoT);maritime transportation;temporal convolutional network (TCN);wave height prediction","Oceans;Convolution;Marine vehicles;Transportation;Predictive models;Safety;Time series analysis","","6","","39","IEEE","19 Apr 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Since road congestion has a big impact on driving times, fleet management can be enhanced by taking into account data on current traffic conditions. Today, most carriers gather high-quality historical traffic data by using global position system information. These data serve as an input for defining time-dependent travel times, i.e. travel times changing according to traffic conditions throughout the day. Given a fixed-size fleet of vehicles and a graph with arc traversal times varying over time, Time-Dependent Vehicle Routing Problems aim to select the best routes while minimizing the travelling costs. The basic version with only one route is usually referred to as the Time-Dependent Travelling Salesman Problem. The main goal of this work is to define tight upper bounds for this problem by reusing the information gained when solving instances with similar features. This is customary in distribution management, where vehicle routes have to be generated over and over again with similar input data. To this aim, the authors devise an upper bounding technique based on the solution of a classical (and simpler) time-independent Asymmetric Travelling Salesman Problem, where the constant arc costs are suitably defined by the combined use of a Linear Program and a mix of unsupervised and supervised Machine Learning techniques. The effectiveness of this approach has been assessed through a computational campaign on the real travel time functions of two European cities: Paris and London. The overall average gap between the proposed heuristic and the best-known solutions is about 0.001%. For 31 instances, new best solutions have been obtained.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2022.3233852","Ministero dell'Universit? e della Ricerca; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10005081","Machine learning;path ranking invariance;time-dependent routing;travelling salesman problem","Routing;Heuristic algorithms;Approximation algorithms;Upper bound;Machine learning algorithms;Technological innovation;Urban areas;Traveling salesman problems;Ranking (statistics)","","3","","31","CCBY","3 Jan 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The design of supply chains that deliver these fuels needs to consider quality variability with special attention to shipping costs, because biofuel feedstocks are voluminous. Stochastic programming models that consider all these considerations incur a heavy computational burden. The present work proposes a hybrid strategy that leverages machine learning to reduce the computational complexity of stochastic programming models via problem space reduction. First, numerous randomly generated reduced-space versions of the problem are solved multiple times to generate a set of solution data based on the concept of bootstrapping. Next, a supervised machine learning algorithm is implemented to predict a potentially beneficial mixed integer linear program problem space from which a near-optimal solution can be obtained. Finally, the mixed integer linear program selects the optimal solution from the reduced space generated by the machine learning algorithm. Through extensive numerical experimentation, we determine how much the problem space can be reduced, how many times the reduced space problem needs to be solved and the best performing machine learning techniques for this application. Several supervised learning algorithms, including logistic regression, decision tree, random forest, support vector machine, and k-nearest neighbors, are evaluated. The numerical experiments demonstrate that our proposed solution procedure yields near-optimal outcomes with a considerably reduced computational burden.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2024.3372516","National Institute of Food and Agriculture (NIFA), U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA), under the Hispanic Serving Institutions Education Grants Program(grant numbers:2020-38422-32258); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10456917","Machine learning;supply chain design;biofuels;stochastic programming","Biomass;Biological system modeling;Costs;Supply chains;Biofuels;Stochastic processes;Moisture measurement;Machine learning;Animals;Energy conversion;Supervised learning","","","","22","CCBYNCND","1 Mar 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The IoUT technology is intricately linked with intelligent boats and ships, smart shores and oceans, automatic marine transportations, positioning and navigation, underwater exploration, disaster prediction and prevention, as well as with intelligent monitoring and security. The IoUT has an influence at various scales ranging from a small scientific observatory, to a mid-sized harbor, and to covering global oceanic trade. The network architecture of IoUT is intrinsically heterogeneous and should be sufficiently resilient to operate in harsh environments. This creates major challenges in terms of underwater communications, whilst relying on limited energy resources. Additionally, the volume, velocity, and variety of data produced by sensors, hydrophones, and cameras in IoUT is enormous, giving rise to the concept of Big Marine Data (BMD), which has its own processing challenges. Hence, conventional data processing techniques will falter, and bespoke Machine Learning (ML) solutions have to be employed for automatically learning the specific BMD behavior and features facilitating knowledge extraction and decision support. The motivation of this article is to comprehensively survey the IoUT, BMD, and their synthesis. It also aims for exploring the nexus of BMD with ML. We set out from underwater data collection and then discuss the family of IoUT data communication techniques with an emphasis on the state-of-the-art research challenges. We then review the suite of ML solutions suitable for BMD handling and analytics. We treat the subject deductively from an educational perspective, critically appraising the material surveyed. Accordingly, the reader will become familiar with the pivotal issues of IoUT and BMD processing, whilst gaining an insight into the state-of-the-art applications, tools, and techniques. Finally, we analyze the architectural challenges of the IoUT, followed by proposing a range of promising direction for research and innovation in the broad areas of IoUT and BMD. Our hope is to inspire researchers, engineers, data scientists, and governmental bodies to further progress the field, to develop new tools and techniques, as well as to make informed decisions and set regulations related to the maritime and underwater environments around the world.","1553-877X","","10.1109/COMST.2021.3053118","Australian Government Research Training Program Scholarship; Beijing Natural Science Foundation(grant numbers:L182032); Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council(grant numbers:EP/N004558/1,EP/P034284/1,EP/P034284/1,EP/P003990/1 (COALESCE)); Royal Society’s Global Challenges Research Fund Grant; European Research Council’s Advanced Fellow Grant QuantCom; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9328873","Internet of Things;big data;underwater network architecture;data acquisition;marine and underwater databases/datasets;underwater wireless sensor network;image and video processing;machine learning;deep neural networks","Big Data;Sensors;Tutorials;Machine learning;Tools;Internet of Things;Distributed databases","","231","","319","IEEE","20 Jan 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Central to the control of USV and USV formations, path planning is the key technology that ensures the navigation safety by generating collision free trajectories. Compared with conventional path planning algorithms, the deep reinforcement learning (RL) based planning algorithms provides a new resolution by integrating a high-level artificial intelligence. This work investigates the application of deep reinforcement learning algorithms for USV and USV formation path planning with specific focus on a reliable obstacle avoidance in constrained maritime environments. For single USV planning, with the primary aim being to calculate a shortest collision avoiding path, the designed RL path planning algorithm is able to solve other complex issues such as the compliance with vehicle motion constraints. The USV formation maintenance algorithm is capable of calculating suitable paths for the formation and retain the formation shape robustly or vary shapes where necessary, which is promising to assist with the navigation in environments with cluttered obstacles.

AVs are envisaged to evolve to a service rather than a product in the future. To provide best user experience of such services, three primary factors, namely, waiting time, travel time, and supply of AV services, are taken into consideration in a multiobjective optimization. Conventional optimization of services relies on traffic flow analysis over a queuing network model. However, due to the mobility of vehicles and the transfer uncertainty of road networks, the queuing network analysis is too complicated and practically intractable. For accuracy and convenient processing, network calculus (NC) is extended to model the queueing problem in this paper. The optimal number of available AVs can be identified by guaranteeing the waiting time of customers. The satisfaction of AV services can be viewed as a supply and demand problem, and optimized by bipartite graph matching. In order to reduce the average travel time, especially for rush hours with heavy traffic, we further propose a new online AVs fleet management scheme with congestion control for smart cities. It is shown that the intelligent management of AV fleet can be efficiently achieved, outperforming the cases of traditional vehicles.

While the nonlinear USV working in the complex ocean environment, the good trajectory tracking performance is an important capacity. However, the nonlinearity, modeling uncertainties (e.g., modeling error and parameter variations) and external disturbance (wind, wave, current, etc) are the main difficulties, which deteriorates the control performance. To solve this issue, most existing algorithms for USV's tracking have been developed based on the linearization of the USV's nonlinear dynamic model at specific equilibrium point. However, the integrated effect of nonlinearities, modeling uncertainties and external disturbance has not been well considered, which can degrade the USV's tracking performance. Therefore, to achieve the good tracking performance for USV, a nonlinear dynamic model is strictly derived in this paper with the integrate consideration of abovementioned issues, and an adaptive sliding mode control design using RBFNN(Radial Basis Function Neural Network) and disturbance-observer is subsequently developed, where a RBFNN approximator is designed to approximate and compensate modeling uncertainties, and a disturbance-observer is designed to estimate and compensate the effect of the external disturbance. Furthermore, the global stability of the overall closed-loop system of USV are strictly guaranteed.

Major results based on this study are summarized as follows, (1) For the first time, the Medimar airborne POLDER data was analyzed from the linear polarization point of view by this study. Several typical aerosol models, namely, the Haze M, water-soluble, oceanic, maritime, continental and Junge-type models were fully tested against both the observed reflectance and linear polarization data at 0.85 /spl mu/m in the principal plane, as well as in the image form with various viewing angle information. (2) By examining various combinations of aerosol's complex refractive indices and wind speeds, the authors found that only the water-soluble model and Junge-type models with /spl nu/=3.5, 4.0, and 4.5 can satisfy the observed reflectance data, but they also found that these models, satisfying the observed reflectance constraints, fail to satisfy the observed linear polarization features in the backward scattering directions. (3) Any aerosol models deduced from the reflectance data analysis should be tested against the polarization data. This study was the first such attempt and all the major aerosol models with a single-peaked size distribution function were rejected, as an appropriate model over the Mediterranean Sea at the Medimar experiment time because they all failed to satisfy the observed polarization data. (4) More studies are certainly needed to find an appropriate aerosol model which can satisfy both the observed reflectance and polarization features. Other types of aerosol models with a multipeaked size distribution function should be fully examined in the future.","1558-0644","","10.1109/36.655317","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=655317","","Scattering;Image analysis;Polarization;Aerosols;Reflectivity;Atmospheric modeling;Data analysis;Testing;Distribution functions;Earth","","13","","16","IEEE","6 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Gathering such data is referred to as Vehicle Telematics, and can be obtained through On-Board Units and AVL (Automatic Vehicle Location) devices. This work aims to compare and evaluate two well-known standards for extracting this vehicle information. Both OBDII and FMS standards are widely used for fleet management and monitoring driving behavior. Through statistical analysis, we propose two algorithms for monitoring instantaneous fuel economy via OBDII. The objective of this research is to determine the best standard for retrieving vehicle sensor data to use when monitoring fuel economy, CO2 emissions, and other attributes that may affect quality of life in Smart Cities.","1558-1748","","10.1109/JSEN.2020.2997129","Irish Research Council & Tech-Auto Ltd.(grant numbers:EBPPG/2018/206); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9099296","Connected vehicles;eco-driving;fleet management systems;OBDII;smart cities;vehicle telematics","Frequency modulation;Standards;Monitoring;Vehicles;Telematics;Smart cities;Fuels","","12","","40","IEEE","25 May 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Customers’ data lie in two categories: soft and hard. The term “hard data” refers to the records generated by various devices and programs, including but not limited to smartphones, computers, sensors, smart meters, fleet management systems, call detail records (CDRs), and consumer bank transaction data. On the other hand, information that is subject to interpretation and viewpoint is known as “soft data.” Fusing these two types of data leads to better customer’s behavior analysis. This paper uses a supervised machine learning algorithm, namely a decision tree (DT), and the change mining method to model hard data. K-means clustering, an unsupervised machine learning algorithm, is also used along with the data preprocessing techniques. This paper also considers the Dempster-Shafer theory and other steps for soft data modeling. By fusing soft and hard data, the churn rate of customers compared with each other can be calculated. Besides, the customers’ banking data are leveraged for data modeling.

Real-time power management of multiple power sources in both design and operation becomes critical due to the uncertainty and randomness of the vessel's power demand. Furthermore, the vessel operators may have additional requirements for operational flexibility, such as fully recharging the battery before the next trip and limiting engine switch on/off to reduce wear-and-tear, which lead to complex power management systems requiring domain-expert knowledge. In this article, a hybrid solution for real-time power management is proposed. The model-based approach encapsulates the power system, and the data-driven approach (a machine learning technique called Markov approximation) handles the uncertainty. First, an offline deterministic optimization problem for power management is formulated. Second, the deterministic problem is transformed into a maximum weighted independent set (MWIS) problem. Next, the Markov approximation framework is applied to the transformed problem to utilize the machine learning techniques widely used in wireless communications and computing industries. Finally, a reinforcement learning-based real-time solution is proposed. Extensive simulations are performed on a ferry case study, and the results are within the proven theoretical bounds of machine learning techniques.","1558-0679","","10.1109/TPWRS.2022.3215153","Singapore Government; Industry Alignment Fund; IAF-ICP(grant numbers:I1801E0033); Rolls-Royce Corporate Lab @ Nanyang Technological University; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9921351","Energy management;energy storage;marine vehicle propulsion;marine vehicles power systems;Markov approximation;optimization methods;power managment systems;reinforcement learning","Engines;Real-time systems;Power systems;Industries;Batteries;Power system management;Marine vehicles","","5","","35","IEEE","17 Oct 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The Back-Propagation Neural Network (BPNN) and Gaussian Process Regression (GPR) techniques in machine learning were used to train and predict the two datasets. Thereafter, the predictive performance of these two techniques was compared and analyzed. Results showed that both techniques were able to accurately predict the ship fuel consumption, especially on the dataset with the influence of marine environmental factors. Quantitatively, the mean prediction accuracy for GPR (mean R2 = 0.9887) is slightly higher than BPNN (mean R2 = 0.9817). However, GPR requires longer runtime (mean T = 2236.4 s) compared to BPNN (mean T = 14.7 s). Due to the longer runtime, GPR is less preferable for online and real-time prediction of enroute ship fuel consumption. The ship real-time fuel consumption data can be accurately predicted by machine learning, which will be beneficial to achieve the goal of ship fuel consumption optimization and greenhouse gas emission reduction in the future.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2019.2933630","Science and Technology Commission of Shanghai Municipality(grant numbers:18DZ1206300); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8790676","Machine learning;Gaussian process regression;back-propagation neural network;enroute ship;fuel consumption prediction","Marine vehicles;Fuels;Machine learning;Environmental factors;Ground penetrating radar;Real-time systems;Wind speed","","55","","25","CCBY","7 Aug 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The realization of such a system, i.e., the VHF data exchange (VDES) satellite system, however, faces many technical challenges. Due to its global broadcasting nature, the interference generated from the emissions of the VDES satellite space stations to the incumbent or future land systems in the same band is of major concern to the International Telecommunication Union (ITU) spectrum allocation. However, neither regulatory rules nor related studies have been specified or made available in the literature regarding such interference. This paper utilizes the electromagnetic power flux density (PFD) mask concept for evaluating and constraining the emission onto earth from a satellite space station. The mathematical analysis and derivation are based on the principle that the actual interference from a space station that a land system experiences is no worse than that from any other land system allowed by the regulations. We demonstrate the derivation of such a PFD mask from three closely related regulations on the legacy land mobile systems by the Electronic Communications Committee (ECC) and ITU and present the corresponding constraints imposed on the VDES satellite system and their impacts on the performance of the system.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2019.2919253","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61771128); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8723373","Maritime Internet of Things;e-navigation;maritime machine-type communication","Satellite broadcasting;Interference;Space stations;Marine vehicles;ITU;Internet of Things;Artificial intelligence","","36","","28","OAPA","27 May 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The Space-Air-Ground Integrated Network (SAGIN) has the advantage of wide-area coverage and can cover global communications. It can meet the needs of network resources for maritime activities and remote mountainous areas, which is of great significance to the realization of a new generation of communications networks. With the development of the network and the emergence of delay-sensitive applications such as the Internet of Things, improving the delay performance of the system has received extensive attention. SAGIN involves multiple networks and is more complex than other networks. If there is no reasonable management between different networks, it is easy to lead to difficult link deployment and high time delay. On the basis of research and customization of SFC technology, it can provide a wide range of services and other advantages. It has significant performance in application scenarios involving multi network integration. In order to solve the above problems, this paper studies the SAGIN architecture of SFC based on business types. A service function chain mapping method based on delays prediction is proposed. Calculate the delay of the deployment path and select the path with the lowest delay as the SFC mapping path. The service model is constructed according to the mapping path, and the network slices are divided based on the service type. The simulation results show that the SFC mapping algorithm based on time delay prediction is compared with the traditional SFC mapping scheme. The algorithm does not affect other indicators, the CPU resource utilization rate is 27.8$\%$ higher, and the link resource utilization rate is 22.7$\%$ higher.

However, there are still many unsolved challenges while using federated learning in IoT-enabled MTS, such as the privacy preservation and Byzantine attacks. To surmount the above challenges, a novel mechanism, namely DisBezant, is designed to achieve the secure and Byzantine-robust federated learning in IoT-enabled MTS. Specifically, a credibility-based mechanism is proposed to resist the Byzantine attack in non-iid (not independent and identically distributed) dataset which is usually gathered from heterogeneous ships. The credibility is introduced to measure the trustworthiness of uploaded knowledge from ships and is updated based on their shared information in each epoch. Then, we design an efficient privacy-preserving gradient aggregation protocol based on a secure two-party calculation protocol. With the help of a central server, we can accurately recognise the Byzantine attackers and update the global model parameters privately. Furthermore, we theoretically discussed the privacy preservation and efficiency of DisBezant. To verify the effectiveness of our DisBezant, we evaluate it over three real datasets and the results demonstrate that DisBezant can efficiently and effectively achieve the Byzantine-robust federated learning. Although there are 40% nodes are Byzantine attackers in participants, our DisBezant can still recognise them and ensure the accurate model training.","1558-0016","","10.1109/TITS.2022.3152156","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61902290,62072352,61872283,61902291,62072487); Key Research and Development Program of Shaanxi(grant numbers:2020ZDLGY09-06,2019ZDLGY12-04); National Statistical Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:2020LD01); Scientific Research Program Funded by Shaanxi Provincial Education Department(grant numbers:20JY016); Guangxi Key Laboratory of Trusted Software(grant numbers:kx202004); Beijing Natural Science Foundation(grant numbers:M21036); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9723014","IoT-enabled MTS;federated learning;privacy preservation;Byzantine-robust learning;credibility","Marine vehicles;Collaborative work;Privacy;Training;Cryptography;Resists;Protocols","","24","","45","IEEE","28 Feb 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Investigating how COVID-19 has affected ship behaviours is significant for economic condition evaluation, port management. This paper develops an analysis method to mine knowledge from raw Automation Identification System (AIS) data. First, berths are identified by improved density-based spatial clustering of applications with noise by Pythagoras distance (PD-DBSCAN). Data features, such as ship deadweight, arrival time, dwelling time, ship types, etc., can then be extracted using information matching and statistical analysis. Next, the dynamic time warping method is employed to analyse abnormal ship behaviour patterns and quantify the impacts of COVID-19. After that, a significance test is employed to determine an impact threshold through year-on-year analysis on ship flow, daily throughout and berthing time of quays. Finally, statistical analysis is used for the short-term impact analysis. This research examines a case study based on four-year AIS data in the Oslo port area. The results show that the proposed method can identify abnormal patterns caused by COVID-19 and estimate its impacts. Passenger ships are influenced heavily compared with cargo ships. The variation of passenger ships’ flow is over 90% during 2020, larger than the average variation before 2020.

Moreover, HTS will also play an important role in the up coming 5G mobile networks where HTS will provide services like disaster relief, remote automation, maritime services etc. However, the distortions caused by the on-board transponder filters and high power amplifiers (HPAs) reduce the overall performance of HTS. To increase the power and bandwidth efficiency, the transponder HPAs are often operated close to saturation and in multicarrier mode. In addition, the transponder filters are built with tighter guard bands to minimize the out-of-band (OOB) radiations. Such operation conditions introduce severe linear and non-linear distortions in the transponder's output in terms of inter-modulation (IMD) noise, spectral regrowth, and memory effects. Digital predistortion (DPD) can effectively mitigate these distortions. This article proposes an on-board implementation of a ground-based state-of-the-art bandlimited memory polynomial (MP) DPD method to mitigate the aforementioned distortions. The authors stress on the fact that the on-board application of the proposed ground-based DPD makes it the most suitable DPD method for HTS. However, the focus of this article lies in the identification of the system parameters which effect the predistortion performance. To this end, the performance of the considered state-of-the-art DPD is thoroughly analyzed for varying uplink-signal, transponder and DPD specific parameters.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3065745","German Aerospace Centre (DLR), Space Administration(grant numbers:50YB1714); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9376970","Bandlimited predistortion;digital predistortion (DPD);high power amplifiers (HPAs);high throughput satellites (HTS);non-linear distortions;on-board processors (OBPs);parameter identification","Predistortion;Nonlinear distortion;High-temperature superconductors;Bandwidth;Satellites;Payloads;Computational modeling","","7","","50","CCBYNCND","12 Mar 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Defined as one of the three key services in 5th Generation (5G), massive Machine Type Communications (mMTC) are intended to enable the wide-spread adoption of IoT services across the globe. Satellite-based Non-Terrestrial Networks (NTN) are crucial in providing connectivity with global coverage including rural and offshore areas, which are fundamental for supporting important use cases in future networks. A rapidly growing market for IoT devices with mMTC applications using NarrowBand-IoT (NB-IoT) will represent a large share of user equipment (UE) in such areas. While standardization efforts for NTN are underway for forthcoming 3GPP releases, they focus on transparent payload architectures where the satellite platform is necessarily connected to a ground station gateway to be able to provide satellite access services to IoT devices, thus requiring complex ground segment infrastructure in low Earth orbit (LEO) constellation deployments to achieve global coverage. In contrast, satellite network deployments targeting the delivery of delay-tolerant IoT applications using NB-IoT, which are a major mMTC use case, can benefit from architectures based on the use of regenerative payloads in the satellite and support for Store and Forward (S&F) operation where satellite access can remain operational even at times when the satellite is not connected to a ground station. In particular, such an approach would allow for extending satellite service coverage in areas where satellites cannot be connected to ground stations (e.g. maritime or very remote areas with lack of ground-stations infrastructures), improving ground segment affordability by enabling operation with fewer ground-stations and allowing more robust operation of the satellite under intermittent feeder link operation. In this paper, we provide a high-level design of an extended 3GPP architecture featuring store and forward mechanisms for IoT NTN delay-tolerant applications that address the previous challenges, as well as a laboratory validation of said architecture for a specific use case.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2022.3184720","Spanish MCIN/AEI/10.13039/501100011033(grant numbers:PID2019-106808RA-I00); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9810201","NB-IoT NTN;LEO constellation;store and forward","Internet of Things;Satellite broadcasting;3GPP;Payloads;Low earth orbit satellites;Standards;Costs","","6","","18","CCBY","29 Jun 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

For instance, car insurance telematics and fleet management entities have been recently using smartphones’ embedded sensors, On-Board Diagnostics II (OBDII) units and other on-board IoT devices to collect data on vehicles’ behavior and evaluate the risk profile of drivers. In this context, this paper presents a robust data-driven framework for calculating drivers’ risk profile measured in terms of the additive inverse of the predicted risk probability. The Strategic Highway Research Program 2 (SHRP2) naturalistic driving study (NDS) dataset, which is the largest dataset of its kind to date, is utilized to build the risk prediction models. Crash and near-crash events are used to quantify riskiness whereas balanced baseline driving events (i.e., events captured during normal day to day driving episodes) are used to reflect total exposure or driving time per driver. Thirteen mutually exclusive behavioral risk predictors are identified, and the feature matrix is formulated. A sensitivity analysis is then performed to find the best number of balanced baseline events below which drivers are filtered out. Different machine learning models are selected, customized, and compared to achieve best risk prediction performance. Finally, the utilization of the proposed prediction model within an envisioned driver profiling cloud-based framework is briefly discussed.","1558-0016","","10.1109/TITS.2020.3035700","Research Center RTTSRC-4-2013 provided by the Roadway Transportation and Traffic Safety Research Center, United Arab Emirates University(grant numbers:31R014); Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC)(grant numbers:STPGP 479248); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9262069","Internet of intelligent vehicles (IoIV);driving behavior profiling;data-driven applications;intelligent transportation systems (ITS);prediction models;vehicle-to-cloud (V2C) applications","Vehicles;Smart phones;Predictive models;Machine learning algorithms;Insurance;Accidents;Sensors","","24","","43","IEEE","17 Nov 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Considering the ship as a large wave buoy, the sea state can be estimated from motion responses without extra sensors installed. This task is challenging since the relationship between the wave and the ship motion is hard to model. Existing methods include a wave buoy analogy (WBA) method, which assumes linearity between wave and ship motion, and a machine learning (ML) approach. Since the data collected from a vessel in the real world are typically limited to a small range of sea states, the ML method might fail when the encountered sea state is not in the training dataset. This article proposes a hybrid approach that combines the above two methods. The ML method is compensated by the WBA method based on the uncertainty of estimation results, and thus, the failure can be avoided. Real-world historical data from the Research Vessel Gunnerus are applied to validate the approach. Results indicate that the hybrid approach improves the estimation accuracy.","1941-0050","","10.1109/TII.2021.3073462","Norges Forskningsråd; Digital Twins For Vessel Life Cycle Service(grant numbers:280703); IKTPLUSS Project; Remote Control Centre for Autonomous Ship Support(grant numbers:309323); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9405466","Autonomous ship;hybrid method;sea state estimation;supervised machine learning","Sea state;Marine vehicles;Estimation;Sea measurements;Machine learning;Uncertainty;Feature extraction","","16","","27","IEEE","15 Apr 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In practice, Hidden Markov Model and its variants are widely used to provide accurate and efficient map matching service. However, HMM-based methods fail to utilize the knowledge (e.g., the mobility pattern) of enormous trajectory big data, which are useful for intelligent map matching. Furthermore, with many following-up works, they are still easily influenced by the common noisy and sparse records in the reality. In this paper, we revisit the map matching task from the data perspective and propose to utilize the great power of massive data and deep learning to solve these problems. Based on the seq2seq learning framework, we build a trajectory2road model with attention mechanism to map the sparse and noisy trajectory into the accurate road network. Different from previous algorithms, our deep learning based model complete the map matching in the latent space, which provides the high tolerance to the noisy trajectory and also enhances the matching with the knowledge of mobility pattern. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed model outperforms the widely used HMM-based methods by more than 10 percent (absolute accuracy) in various situations especially the noisy and sparse settings.","1558-0660","","10.1109/TMC.2020.3043500","Beijing Natural Science Foundation(grant numbers:L182038); National Key Research and Development Program of China(grant numbers:2018YFB1800804); National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:U1936217,61971267,61972223,61941117,61861136003); Tsinghua University; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9288879","Map matching;deep learning;geographic information system","Trajectory;Hidden Markov models;Roads;Noise measurement;Deep learning;Data models;Pattern matching","","13","","34","IEEE","9 Dec 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In this paper, a target tracking algorithm for USV's vision is proposed, which considers motion features of the USV, such as velocity, pitch and heading. Firstly, a CM(Centroid Matching) method for the target detection is proposed based on FT(Frequency-Tuned) saliency method, which can remove environment disturbances. Secondly, a fDSST(fast Discriminative Scale Space Tracker) is improved for target tracking by considering motion information of the USV from aboard GPS and IMU(Inertial Measurement Unit), where the learning rates of the correlation filters are adjusted adaptively according to variety of the velocity, pitch and heading of the USV. Lastly, the modified target detection and tracking are integrated to acquire a robust tracking result. Based on our USV called as `Jiuhang 490', sea tracking trials for rubber boat in four encountering scenes are executed at Nanjiang port in Qingdao city, China in July 2018.

Sending and storing such vehicle trajectory data cause sustainable communication and storage overheads. Trajectory data compression becomes a promising way to alleviate overhead issues. However, previous solutions are commonly carried out at the side of the data center after data having been received, thus saving the storage cost only. Here, we bring the idea of mobile edge computing and transfer the computation-intensive data compression task to the mobile devices of drivers. As a result, the trajectory data is reduced at the side of data generators before being sent out; thus, it can lower data communication and storage costs simultaneously. We propose DAVT, an error-bounded trajectory data representation, and a compression framework. Specifically, the trajectory data is reformatted into three parts (i.e., Distance, Acceleration & Velocity, and Time), and three compressors are wisely devised to compress each part. For D and AV parts, a similar Huffman tree-forest structure is exploited to encode data elements effectively, but with quite different rationales. For the T part, the large absolute timestamps are transformed to small time intervals firstly, and different encoding techniques are adopted based on the data quality. We evaluate our proposed system using a large-scale taxi trajectory dataset collected from the city of Beijing, China.

Its ultimate goal is to ensure safe & efficient marine operation by ship intelligence. In particular, during a docking operation, situation awareness based on precise motion prediction is of great importance. Knowledge-based ship models, developed based on the understanding of ship dynamics and simplifications, have played an important role in ship intelligence. However, they do not fully handle highly nonlinear and complex ship dynamics in the docking operation beyond our explicit understanding. On the contrary, data-driven models deal with such non-linearity and complexity in a non-parametric manner, however, the maritime industry does not regard them as reliable and applicable models due to the lack of interpretability and the physics foundation. To alleviate this dilemma, this study proposes a physics-data co-operative ship dynamic model for the docking operation; a knowledge-based ship model serves as a physics foundation with supportive data-driven models compensating a single-step-ahead velocity prediction error made by a physics foundation model. Neural networks trained with onboard sensor data are employed in supportive data-driven models. In a case study, we conducted full-scale docking operations of a 28.9m-length research vessel Gunnerus. The results show that mean prediction error in a position at 30s future is reduced by 34.6% compared to that made solely by a physics foundation model.

Many mobile location estimation techniques had been proposed to improve the accuracy of location estimation. Location estimation based on artificial intelligence techniques is a recent alternative approach. In this paper, adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) is used as a robust location estimator to locate the mobile station (MS) using the MS geo-fencing area data within 9 km from a serving base station. Extensive evaluations and comparisons have been performed, and a set of statistical parameters has been obtained. From the comparison of the proposed ANFIS estimator with the neural-network-based estimators, it is found that ANFIS estimator is faster and more robust. Its average computation time (ACT) is 0.076 sec. While the ACT for multilayer perceptron (MLP) and radial-based function (RBF) neural networks is 0.88 and 1.7, respectively. Whereas on comparing ANFIS with other techniques, it is found that in ANFIS estimator, 67 percent of the estimated location errors do not exceed 149 m, while these for the statistical, multiple linear regression, and geometric are 170, 280, and 2,346 m, respectively.

Numerous microservices, such as fleet management, cloud computing, and data security, integrate and execute the framework in pre- and post-flood situations. Labeling data from the proposed framework generates a support vector machine-based classifier for predicting flood risk. Furthermore, a hybrid A* algorithm is developed to find an optimal route for the rescue operation.

Existing methods predominantly rely on optical sensors such as LiDAR and cameras to discern maritime obstacles within the short- to mid-range distances. Nonetheless, conventional cameras encounter challenges in water conditions that curtail their effectiveness in localizing obstacles and planning paths. Furthermore, LiDAR has limitations regarding angular resolution and identifying objectness due to data sparsity. To overcome these limitations, our proposed system leverages a stereo camera equipped with enhanced angular resolution to augment situational awareness. The system employs recursive estimation techniques to ascertain the position and dimensions of proximate obstacles, transmitting this information to the onboard control unit, where MOOS-IvP behaviour-based software produces navigation decisions. Through the real-time fusion of data obtained from the stereo vision system and navigational data, the system is able to achieve Enhance Situational Awareness (ESA) and facilitate well-informed navigation decisions. Developing a state-of-the-art maritime object detection technique, the system adeptly identifies obstacles and swiftly responds via a vision integration protocol. During field tests, our system proves the efficacy of the proposed ESA approach. This paper also presents a comprehensive analysis and discussion of the results derived from deploying the proposed system on the Suraya Surveyor USV platform across numerous scenarios featuring diverse obstacles.

Previous researchers mostly utilized the geometric, radiometric, and structural features combined with the traditional machine-learning (ML) methods to conduct ship classification in high-resolution (HR) SAR images. However, the handcrafted features showed weak representation for the medium-resolution (MR) SAR images, and the normal ML methods are less powerful to deal with the intraclass diversity and interclass similarity in the MR SAR ship images. To address these issues, this article extends the dense convolutional networks to the MR SAR ship classification for better deep features extraction and proposes a multitask learning framework within which the softmax log-loss and the triplet loss are jointly minimized for more effective ship classification in MR SAR images. The triplet loss is computed by imposing a similarity constraint on the deep embeddings via the deep metric learning (DML) scheme such that the deep representations of the same class are pulled much closer to each other and those from different classes are pushed as farther apart as possible. However, the triplet loss in the usual DML utilizes the triplets mined in a training batch independently, which ignores the contextual information. So, we propose to impose a Fisher discrimination regularization term on the deep embeddings to explore the global information of learned embeddings, and hence the designed task-specific networks will be trained to have more robust and better recognition performance. Extensive experiments on the MR SAR ship data set collected from the Sentinel-1 SAR images demonstrate that the proposed method can achieve superior performance for the 3- and 5-class recognition tasks with regard to the comparing CNN models.","1558-0644","","10.1109/TGRS.2020.3009284","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61671354); National Science Fund for Distinguished Young Scholars of China(grant numbers:61525105); Fund for Foreign Scholars in University Research and Teaching Programs through the 111 Project(grant numbers:B18039); Shaanxi Innovation Team Project; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9146990","Densely connected convolutional networks;Fisher discrimination;medium resolution (MR);metric learning;ship classification;synthetic aperture radar (SAR)","Marine vehicles;Synthetic aperture radar;Measurement;Training;Task analysis;Scattering;Surveillance","","58","","96","IEEE","24 Jul 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

High strain rate transient bending produced by such loads may result in failure of fine pitch electronic interconnects. Current experimental techniques rely on electrical resistance for determination of failure. Significant advantage can be gained by prior knowledge of impending failure for applications where the consequences of system failure may be catastrophic. This research effort focuses on an alternate approach to damage quantification in electronic assemblies subjected to shock and vibration, without testing for electrical continuity. The proposed approach can be extended to monitor product level damage. In this paper, statistical pattern recognition and leading indicators of shock damage have been used to study the damage initiation and progression in shock and drop of electronic assemblies. Statistical pattern recognition is currently being employed in a variety of engineering and scientific disciplines such as biology, psychology, medicine, marketing, artificial intelligence, computer vision, and remote sensing . The application quantification of shock damage in electronic assemblies is new. Previously, free vibration of rectangular plates has been studied by various researchers for development of analytical closed form models. In this paper, closed form models have been developed for the eigen frequencies and mode shapes of electronic assemblies with various boundary conditions and component placement configurations. Model predictions have been validated with experimental data from modal analysis. Pristine configurations have been perturbed to quantify the degradation in confidence values with progression of damage. Sensitivity of leading indicators of shock damage to subtle changes in boundary conditions, effective flexural rigidity, and transient strain response has been quantified. A damage index for experimental damage monitoring has been developed using the failure indicators. The above damage monitoring approach is not based on electrical continuity and hence can be applied to any electronic assembly structure irrespective of the interconnections. The damage index developed provides parametric damage progression data, thus removing the limitation of current failure testing, where the damage progression cannot be monitored. Hence the proposed method does not require the assumption that the failure occurs abruptly after some number of drops and can be extended to product level drops.","1557-9972","","10.1109/TCAPT.2008.916853","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4454214","Printed circuit board (PCB)","Electric shock;Assembly;Consumer electronics;Condition monitoring;Vibrations;Capacitive sensors;Pattern recognition;Biological system modeling;Boundary conditions;Electric resistance","","56","","53","IEEE","3 Mar 2008","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Therefore, the actual antenna pattern must be measured and used. In order to remove the requirement of antenna pattern measurement, a new method for target DOA estimation from wide-beam HF radar data using support vector regression (SVR) is proposed in this letter. A system model that relates target bearing and radar data feature is obtained through the SVR-based machine learning using the automatic identification system data and data associated with the vessels successfully detected by the HF radar. Then, such a model is used to determine the DOAs of targets from new data.

Underwater acoustic communications (UAC) network channels are fast-varying (spatially and temporally) according to environmental conditions. It is tempting to use adaptive modulation and coding (AMC) for UAC networks to improve the system efficiency by matching transmission parameters to channel variations. This paper focuses on analyzing a measured sea trial dataset by using a rule-based strategy (i.e., three-dimensional analysis, modulation-wise analysis, and a fixed-SNR strategy) to find the suitable link adaptation procedure depending on the channel quality. Hence, we plot a scenario of the measured UAC network data rate vs. Signal to Noise Ratio (SNR) and/or Bit Error Rate (BER) to pick the best AMC combinations in the context of adaptivity to the channel. Due to non-reversibility limitation of rule-based strategy, the work further extends to use machine learning (ML) algorithms to classify the MCS levels by investigating the channel characteristics. Boosted regression tree, from among the four ML algorithms we adopted for the analysis, shows formidable accuracy of 99.97% in classifying MCS levels. This ensemble of trees learns from the uplink data of the buoy and the base station and relates the MCS levels to channel metrics and signal characteristics especially subject to SNR and BER constraints.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2020.2981973","Ministry of Oceans and Fisheries, South Korea, through the Project titled Development of Distributed Underwater Monitoring and Control Networks; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9042325","Boosted regression tree analysis;K-nearest neighbors;link adaptation;machine learning;pseudo-linear discriminant analysis;support vector machine;UAC network","Sea measurements;Signal to noise ratio;Delays;Bit error rate;Frequency measurement;Modulation;Encoding","","28","","31","CCBY","19 Mar 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Using laser-pulse techniques, DAS turns (commercial) fiber-optic cables into seismic arrays with a spatial sampling density of the order of meters and a time sampling rate up to one thousand Hertz. The versatility of DAS enables dense instrumentation of traditionally inaccessible domains, such as urban, glaciated, and submarine environments. This in turn opens up novel applications such as traffic density monitoring and maritime vessel tracking. However, these new environments also introduce new challenges in handling various types of recorded noise, impeding the application of traditional data analysis workflows. In order to tackle the challenges posed by noise, new denoising techniques need to be explored that are tailored to DAS. In this work, we propose a Deep Learning approach that leverages the spatial density of DAS measurements to remove spatially incoherent noise with unknown characteristics. This approach is entirely self-supervised, so no noise-free ground truth is required, and it makes no assumptions regarding the noise characteristics other than that it is spatio-temporally incoherent. We apply our approach to both synthetic and real-world DAS data to demonstrate its excellent performance, even when the signals of interest are well below the noise level.

We model the UAVs tracking system as an energy consumption optimization problem with the constraint of task latency. Although the proposed optimization problem is complex, we transform the optimization problem into several subproblems with decoupling and rigorous mathematical proof.

A combination network consisting of a convolutional neural network (CNN) to extract spatial features and a long short-term memory (LSTM) for extracting temporal patterns in the spatial features is proposed. The network augments the detector structure by blanking out regions of the frame which are classified as not containing a target, thus reducing false alarms. The network is tested on data containing four marine targets collected by a ground-based radar. The data set was chosen because it contains strong sea clutter returns. When ML is used, the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves are shifted to lower probability of false alarm (PFA). A Kalman filter tracker was applied to the ML-augmented and baseline detections, and it was shown that ML-augmented detections produced similar tracks at lower PFA.

However, traditional multibeam or light detection and ranging (LiDAR) survey techniques used to produce high-quality bathymetric maps are expensive. Satellite-derived bathymetry provides a fast and inexpensive method for the large-scale mapping of shallow-water areas and can overcome the complexities of traditional bathymetric mapping methods in these areas. Traditionally, linear regression models, most commonly the Stumpf model, are used for satellite-based bathymetric modeling. However, nonlinear artificial neural network (ANN) models have been recently developed and implemented for satellite-based bathymetric modeling and are under significant investigation to develop the most accurate and optimal model. This article proposes two new hybrid ANN-based models for bathymetric modeling and investigates their performance using satellite imagery data and “truth” depth data for a coastal shallow-water study area. Two-hybrid ANN algorithms are developed, namely, particle swarm optimization (PSO)-ANN and optimally pruned extreme learning machine (OPELM), and their results are compared with the traditional Stumpf method and current state-of-the-art ANN model. The study area dataset comprises the “truth” depth data from a nautical chart of the Alqumriyah Island study area in Saudi Arabia and the corresponding spectral reflection values of green, blue, and near-infrared bands from the free-of-charge Level-1C product of Sentinel-2A images used to train and validate the two newly developed models and the traditional models. The results show that the developed OPELM method can accurately derive the bathymetry and is superior to the developed PSO-ANN model, the current state-of-the-art ANN model, and the traditional Stumpf model by 12.10%, 18.76%, and 32.46%, respectively. The OPELM model can also be used for bathymetric modeling of shallow-water areas with depths up to 30 m with a high level of accuracy compared with the current state-of-the-art ANN and traditional methods. The significant contribution of this research is that it is the first investigation of the artificial intelligence-based hybrid OPELM method for accurate bathymetric modeling and will certainly encourage further investigations of hybrid models.

However, big data size increases the cost of storing, querying, and processing AIS data in practical applications. AIS data includes not only the ship spatial position information but also the course, speed, heading information et al. In other words, the knowledge of ship handling behavior is hidden in AIS data. In fact, many practical applications, such as maritime accident investigation and evidence collection, route extraction, ship behavior analysis, will require a compression algorithm to retain the ship key handling points in the original trajectory. To address these research challenges, the ship trajectory compression algorithm considering handling patterns is proposed in this paper. In order to explain the implicit handling patterns of AIS trajectories, the suggested method adopts the rate of course change (ROCC) and the rate of speed change (ROSC) in the sliding window as the criterion of whether the current trajectory point can be simplified. Numerical experiments are performed to verify the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm. Compared with Douglas-Peucker (DP) algorithm, Sliding Window (SW) algorithm, Opening Window Time Ratio (OPW-TR) algorithm, the results show that the proposed algorithm can efficiently compress trajectories by considering ship behavior patterns under application requirement.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3078642","National Key Research and Development Program of China(grant numbers:2018YFB1601505); Liaoning Provincial Shipping Joint Fund(grant numbers:2020-HYLH-28); National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:51309044); Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities(grant numbers:3132019313); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9427209","Automatic identification system;handling patterns;ship trajectory;sliding window;trajectory compression","Marine vehicles;Trajectory;Artificial intelligence;Compression algorithms;Heuristic algorithms;Turning;Shape","","12","","33","CCBYNCND","10 May 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Extensive monitoring in these– often remote– areas is challenging. Machine learning methods are useful in object detection and classification tasks and have the potential to underpin techniques for the development of robust monitoring systems to overcome this problem. However, development is hindered due to the limited number of publicly available labelled and curated datasets. Furthermore, there are relatively few open-source state-of-the-art methods to be used for evaluation. This paper presents an investigation of automated classification methods using underwater acoustic signals to infer the presence and type of vessels navigating in coastal regions. Various combinations of deep convolutional neural network architectures, and preprocessing filter layers, were evaluated using a new dataset based on a subset of the extensive open-source Ocean Networks Canada hydrophone data. Tests were conducted in which VGGNet and ResNet networks were applied to classify the input data. The data was preprocessed using either Constant Q Transform (CQT), Gammatone, Mel spectrogram, or a combination of these filters. With over 97% accuracy, using all three preprocessing representations simultaneously yielded the most reliable result. However, high accuracies of 94.95% were achieved using CQT as the preprocessing filter for a ResNet-based convolutional neural network, providing a trade-off between model complexity and accuracy; a result that is more than 10% higher than previously reported approaches. This more accurate classifier for underwater acoustics could be used as a reliable autonomous monitoring system in maritime environments.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2022.3220265","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9940921","Deep learning;hydrophones;marine environment;ship type;sound","Underwater acoustics;Deep learning;Acoustics;Spectrogram;Sonar equipment;Time-frequency analysis;Surveillance;Marine equipment","","10","","57","CCBY","7 Nov 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Such conditions depend on the Fenchel-Legendre transform of the cumulant-generating function of the Data-Driven Decision Function (D3F, i.e., what is thresholded before the final binary decision is made) learned in the training phase. As such, the D3F and the related error rate $I$ depend on the given training set. The conditions for the exponential convergence can be verified and tested numerically exploiting the available dataset or a synthetic dataset generated according to the underlying statistical model. Coherently with the large deviations theory, we can also establish the convergence of the normalized D3F statistic to a Gaussian distribution. Furthermore, approximate error probability curves $\zeta _{n} \exp (-n\,I)$ are provided, thanks to the refined asymptotic derivation, where $\zeta _{n}$ represents the most representative sub-exponential terms of the error probabilities. Leveraging the refined asymptotic, we are able to compute an accurate analytical approximation of the classification performance for both the regimes of small and large values of $n$.

In this paper, we investigate the information transmission and the collision avoidance problem in the complex vessel networks, in which the devices are equipped with the capability of Artificial Intelligence (AI). With the empowered learning ability in the networks, we propose a novel two-step-smooth-turn cooperative collision avoidance mechanism for the dynamic vessel networks, considering the motion states of the vessels. In particular, the AI-powered vessels network motion model is designed, which can learn the motion information to predict the safety motion states by automatic collection of the information. Then, a K-Means algorithm combining with genetic algorithm is proposed by expanding the operation of cross genetic and genetic mutations, which can achieve the optimal multi-vessels coordination motion policy for the collision avoidance.

The recent focus on autonomous ships has sparked intensive research and innovation activities of dock-to-dock operations, including the final docking phase. Specifically, automated docking involves systems that enable vessels to dock safely, independently, and energy-efficiently at designated locations with a specific heading. Challenges include managing large sideslip angles, static and dynamic obstacles, and navigation in complex port geometries. Despite its complexity, the docking problem has received less attention compared to dynamic positioning or course-keeping systems. This paper therefore provides a thorough overview of the research on automated docking for marine surface vessels, from 1980 to June 2023. The paper introduces the Docking Characteristic Index (DCI) as a metric to identify the scope and approach of systems addressing various docking challenges, not as an evaluation of their overall quality. Using the calculated DCI-Scores, we discuss some of the works in more detail. The survey reveals a rising trend in publications and an increasing emphasis on experimental verification. Despite advancements, current methodologies exhibit trade-offs and limitations, particularly in handling dynamic obstacles, robustness against external forces, and situational awareness. The paper identifies the need for more comprehensive and integrated solutions to these challenges. As the demand for fully autonomous operations grows, the results suggest that future research should focus on developing holistic and robust docking strategies, that are verified experimentally, to achieve safe, efficient, and effective automated docking systems.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2023.3335912","Research Council of Norway (SFI AutoShip)(grant numbers:309230); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10325458","Autonomous ships;autonomous surface vehicles;berthing;docking;marine robotics;marine surface vessels;motion control;mooring;survey","Surveys;Marine vehicles;Industries;Indexes;Vehicle dynamics;Seaports;Navigation;Autonomous robots;Marine vehicles;Motion control","","7","","231","CCBY","21 Nov 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In this regard, because batteries are the main power source in underwater environments, there is a clear need to minimize the consumption of energy. In addition, underwater links that make use of acoustic soundwaves can cause relatively long propagation delays. In our proposed scheme, we focus on the initial connection procedure between sensor nodes and underwater base stations to tackle these environmental problems, in which the former estimates the signal strength of the latter. From local information measured during the initial network entry phase, underwater sensor nodes determine locational priority of candidate targets, but do not scan or measure the signal strength of other neighbouring underwater base stations as a means of keeping the power consumption to an absolute minimum. This can be considered an appropriate scenario for use in severely battery-limited environments such as IoUT. Based on analysis using machine learning, we obtain meaningful clues regarding the procedure for handover prediction without channel measurement. By removing the overhead from the channel measurement, the power consumption of the underwater things can be minimized. Two different methods of deciding on handover priority are suggested and analysed mathematically. The performance of each method is evaluated through intensive system-level simulations and compared to that of a more conventional scheme.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2020.3029602","‘Development of Distributed Underwater Monitoring and Control Networks‘; Ministry of Oceans and Fisheries, South Korea; Basic Science Research Program through the National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF); Ministry of Education(grant numbers:2020R1A6A1A12047945); MSIT (Ministry of Science and ICT), Korea, under the Grand Information Technology Research Center support program(grant numbers:IITP-2020-0-01462); IITP (Institute for Information & communications Technology Planning & Evaluation); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9217496","Locational priority;machine learning;handover prediction","Handover;Sea measurements;Predictive models;Machine learning;Oceans;Wireless communication","","5","","48","CCBY","8 Oct 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Until early 2000, ship detection relied on human intelligence, but with the fast-processing speed, artificial intelligence (AI), especially deep learning, has replaced manual intervention with automatic localization in tracking naval activities. Taking advantage of the continuous and cloud-free ocean observations of Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR), recent studies have demonstrated some success in utilizing SAR data to localize ships using deep-learning and other AI methods despite the accuracy of the models being lower than the acceptable limit. However, the existing models are inherently complex and time consuming in addition to demanding an extensive computational resource, which pose a significant challenge when applied to satellite-based data. This study presents a computationally efficient deep-learning-based algorithm that has a wider applicability and improves the accuracy over the existing models for ship localization in SAR images. Training and testing of this algorithm were conducted using the SAR Ship Dataset, which contains ship chips with complex backgrounds extracted from Gaofen-3 and Sentinel-1 satellite data. It produced the localized ship’s position with bounding boxes in SAR images using the combined traditional computer vision and deep neural network configuration, which comprises a novel backbone network called Ship-Net or S-Net. The S-Net model has a thirteen-layer backbone feature extraction network and a four-layer regression network concatenated. Further, this study proposes a modified combined loss function for optimizing the model performance. A comparative analysis of the proposed S-Net model was done using the various pre-build model architectures and loss function combinations. The results showed that the S-Net model with a combined loss function yielded 94.88% precision and 79.68% recall, with 12.58% precision and 7.39% recall higher than the state-of-the-art Faster RCNN baseline model. The proposed S-Net model has a relatively higher performance than the existing state-of-the-art models for ship localization in SAR images and can become an efficient tool for ship localization in optical images with suitable architectural and training scheme modifications for better coastal surveillance and worldwide naval security.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2023.3310539","Prime Minister Research Fellowship (PMRF) Scheme, Government of India, through the PMRF Research Grant; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10235952","Deep-learning;maritime surveillance;object detection;ship detection;SAR","Marine vehicles;Location awareness;Feature extraction;Computational modeling;Radar polarimetry;Detectors;Training;Deep learning;Object detection;Tracking;Surveillance;Synthetic aperture radar","","4","","31","CCBYNCND","31 Aug 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The proposed model modifies Variational Autoencoder (VAE) by changing the inferential distribution of prior distribution and approximate posterior to the Gaussian mixture model. A high-dimensional hidden space is constructed to learn the features of multi-class trajectory data, and the Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) method is applied to measure the error between the reconstructed trajectory and the original trajectory in order to judge whether the ship trajectory is abnormal.

The research results indicate that the detection rate of the proposed model is 91.26%, and the false alarm rate is 0.68%, which performs the best.

With developments in computation and artificial intelligence, it is increasingly important to measure and classify underwater ship signatures. In this work, we design an artificial neural network that classifies commercial ships based on their multi-influence signature. In total, 103 ship passages were included in the considered data set, with signatures recorded as the ship crossed a line of passive underwater sensors. The multi-influence signature was formed by feature-level sensor fusion of the hydroacoustic signature, the underwater electric potential, and the static and alternating magnetic signatures. Ships were classified according to size, or type, as broadcast on the AIS. With feature-level fusion, the neural network will optimize the relationship between different types of signatures, emphasizing features with greater predictive power. At the same time, weak features, even if not independently adequate for classification, can add information that improves accuracy further. The developed neural network achieved a classification accuracy of 87.4% when classifying according to size. With augmented data to balance the classes, 85.0% classification accuracy was achieved when classifying according to ship type. This is a large improvement on the found classification accuracy when using only hydroacoustic or electromagnetic signatures.

However, USVs struggle to accomplish emerging computation-intensive tasks (e.g., sensor, telemetry, etc) timely due to the limited on-board resources. This article proposes a novel reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS)-assisted unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) multiaccess edge computing (MEC) network architecture to support low-latency USVs data computation with time window. Aiming to enhance USVs task processing efficiency, the minimization of USVs task processing time is formulated by jointly considering UAVs flight route selection, USVs execution mode selection, UAVs hovering coordinates, and RIS phase shift vector. A heuristic solution is proposed to tackle the formulated challenging problem iteratively.

This solution allows for early collision detection when two or more ships are on a collision course. In the newer version of AIS, a satellite infrastructure is used to extend the communication range. Unfortunately, satellite AIS deals with so-called packet collision effect: since there is a problem with synchronizing AIS data coming from multiple terrestrial areas, a single satellite may receive several AIS messages at the same time and be unable to correctly process them, causing the data to get lost or garbled. In this article, a machine learning based framework for detecting the incorrect AIS data is presented. In this approach, after the first stage (clustering), a dedicated anomaly detection algorithm searches for damaged AIS messages and conducts multi-label classification (with Random Forest and wavelet transform) to decide which fields of such message requires further correction.

Such a cyber-physical system faces the risk of cyberattacks and internal disturbances posing hazardous situations within the terminal. Therefore, it becomes crucial to identify and mitigate any cyberattacks as well as disturbances during the docking and undocking procedures. This research aims to develop an observer-based detection and mitigation system for actuator attacks and disturbances for autonomous docking of HDVs, employing a point stabilization-based control strategy. The methodology outlined in this study involves analytical proof of the asymptotic stability of the detection and mitigation system, complemented by numerical simulations and experiments to provide a quantitative evaluation. The proposed system design utilizes the Lyapunov direct method to establish the asymptotic stability of the detection system and subsequently integrates it with the point stabilization controller to design the mitigation system, ultimately contributing to the asymptotic stability of the desired configuration for docking the vehicles. The simulation of autonomous docking is performed, demonstrating the ability of the detection and mitigation system, in conjunction with the point stabilization controller, to detect simulated actuator attacks and mitigate their effects, resulting in a smooth docking process at the desired configuration. Experimental results validate the effectiveness of the controller, as the vehicle consistently achieves the desired configuration.

Kalman filtering has been widely applied in multi-sensor data fusion, and researchers are trialing variants of the Kalman Filter (KF) to improve the operational robustness of vehicles in a range of environments under varying dynamic constraints. This paper proposes a novel sensor data fusion algorithm employing an Unscented Kalman Filter (UKF) for the autonomous navigation of an Unmanned Surface Vehicle (USV). Since the navigational sensors on-board the USV are subject to operational uncertainties caused by equipment limitations and environmental disturbances, an improved UKF algorithm with the capability of adaptive estimation, namely fuzzy adaptive UKF data fusion algorithm, has been proposed to obtain reliable navigational information. The conventional UKF is capable of fusing a number of raw sensor measurements and generating relatively accurate estimations with proper a priori knowledge of system noise. To deal with systems that lack such information, a fuzzy adaptive estimation method is introduced to enhance the performance of the conventional UKF, making the algorithm capable of verifying and correcting the associated sensor noise in real time. The proposed fuzzy adaptive UKF data fusion algorithm has been tested and evaluated in different simulations modeled using practical maritime environments and the results are compared with the conventional UKF. The sensor measurements taken from a practical USV trial have also been applied to the proposed algorithm for further validation.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2019.2909151","ACCeSS Group; The Atlantic Centre for the innovative design and Control of Small Ships (ACCeSS) is an ONR-NNRNE Programme(grant numbers:N0014-10-1-0652); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8685692","Unscented Kalman Filter (UKF);adaptive estimation;USV navigation;fuzzy logic;multi-sensor data fusion","Navigation;Kalman filters;Data integration;Noise measurement;Adaptive estimation;Data models;Heuristic algorithms","","53","","28","OAPA","11 Apr 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Automatic identification system (AIS) is used to obtain the motion information of surrounding ships and their dimensional specifications. With AIS information, appropriate collision risk assessment between two ships can be performed; further, collision avoidance can be achieved by defining a safe radius of avoidance, which can be determined considering the shape parameters of a target ship. However, AIS data are often unreliable and some commercial fishing vessels intentionally turn off the public tracking system to hide their location. Under these circumstances, marine radars are used to detect and estimate the motion information of nearby ships. However, most existing target tracking studies model the target as a point object without any spatial extent, and thus, its physical dimensions cannot be identified. In this paper, a target tracking method that uses a marine radar is proposed to simultaneously estimate the motion states (i.e., position, course, and speed) of a target ship and its geometric parameter (length) in the framework of an extended Kalman filter (EKF). The proposed approach enhances collision avoidance by providing the kinematic and length parameters to evaluate collision risk and generate an appropriate collision-free path. Real-sea experiments using a developed USV system were conducted to verify and demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed algorithm; the results are presented and discussed in this paper.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3063836","Unmanned Vehicles Core Technology Research and Development Program through the National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF) and Unmanned Vehicle Advanced Research Center (UVARC); Ministry of Science and ICT, the Republic of Korea (Development of unmanned surface vehicle for autonomous cooperation)(grant numbers:NRF-2020M3C1C1A02086423); Promotion of Innovative Businesses for Regulation-Free Special Zones; Ministry of SMEs and Startups (MSS), South Korea (Demonstration of Unmanned Surface Vehicle for a Maritime Survey)(grant numbers:P0012448); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9369388","Geometric parameter estimation;marine radar;target motion analysis;unmanned surface vehicle","Marine vehicles;Target tracking;Radar tracking;Radar;Tracking;Shape;Collision avoidance","","11","","35","CCBY","4 Mar 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The leader–follower formation control method then enabled the path tracking of the follower ship to the leader ship. Finally, an improved artificial potential field method was used for local collision avoidance, and virtual obstacles were added to improve the situation in which the ship probably entered a local minimum point. The experimental results revealed that the proposed algorithm could plan a route with time, smoothness, and safety advantages for the formation leader and quickly form a stable formation.

Existing positioning methods are either inaccurate (e.g. RSSI-based ranging), impractical (e.g. fingerprinting), or uncommon (e.g. Ultra-Wide Band/UWB). WiFi Round-Trip Time (RTT) marries the ubiquity of WiFi infrastructure with the accuracy of such ranging mechanisms as those used in UWB. We present WhereArtThou, a commercial-grade, plug-and-play indoor positioning solution (IPS) based on WiFi RTT. Our base algorithm uses an extended Kalman filter with a random walk motion model (EKF-RW) which relies solely on RTT distance measurements. We propose two EKF components to enhance positioning accuracy. First, as distance measurements can further be fused with inertial sensor readings, we propose a step-and-heading-based filter (EKF-SH) when such readings are available. We devise a method to fit the non-Gaussian step error with a Gaussian random variable to remain within the computationally-efficient Kalman filtering framework. Second, we define a distance-dependent measurement model to match the true statistics of the measurement noise and approach optimal position estimation. Moreover, we measure the gain from the proposed enhancements not only through the almost-exclusively-used error metric in the indoor positioning literature, the Euclidean distance and its variations, but also through metrics commonly used in satellite and maritime navigation, the cross-track and along-track errors, in addition to a set of metrics of our own definition. Finally, we show that RTT is highly susceptible to the human body holding the device measuring it, and we case-study the impact of human-body blockage on positioning and ranging errors. We test our algorithms on over 18 hours of walking data collected on different devices, in different locations, and with different users, and we observe that the EKF-RW and EKF-SH achieve 90th percentile distance errors of 1.65 m and 1.45 m, and 90th percentile cross-track errors of 0.85 m and 1.55 m, making our solution primed for commercial deployment.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2024.3377237","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10472472","Indoor positioning;indoor localization;wireless positioning;device-based positioning;range-based positioning;WiFi round-trip time (RTT);fine-timing measurement (FTM);ranging;Bayesian filter;Kalman filter;pedestrian dead reckoning (PDR);inertial measurement unit (IMU);ground truth","Distance measurement;Wireless fidelity;Position measurement;Phase measurement;Particle measurements;Measurement uncertainty;Atmospheric measurements;Indoor positioning systems;Bayes methods;Kalman filters;Dead reckoning;Pedestrians","","2","","50","CCBYNCND","18 Mar 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In addition to the clustering of the vessels, determined by the drone’s electro-optical sensor range, we introduce a novel technique to bias a traveling salesman problem (TSP) tour. This bias is based on deliberately increasing distances to vessels that are classified as probable fishing vessels. This increase in distance is meant to prioritize visits to probable fishing vessels. Vessels are classified based on their length. The classification result and the vessel clustering are available before the actual planning of the tour. Simulations of scenarios in which we have a few vessels fishing illegally show that the novel technique, the bias-TSP, combined with a tour orientation based on operational considerations, outperforms the classic TSP: the mean distance traveled to find all the vessels involved in illegal fishing activities is reduced by at least 35–50%. We also show that different drone take-off locations significantly impact the results.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2023.3252013","Brazilian Air Force; Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Científico e Tecnológico(grant numbers:311324/2016-9,307691/2020-9); Coordenação de Aperfeiçoamento de Pessoal de Nível Superior (CAPES), Brazil(grant numbers:001); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10058498","Optimization methods;design of experiments;traveling salesman problem (TSP);decision support systems;drones","Optimization;Surveillance;Drones;Planning;Costs;Meters;Traveling salesman problems;Decision support systems;Design of experiments","","1","","20","CCBY","3 Mar 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"
"Ship Collision Avoidance Based on the Vulnerability Assessment for Small Vessels in Bad Weather","H. Yancai; W. Mingyu; L.

This paper proposes a collision avoidance decision-making and control method for small vessels using the integrated collision risk assessment based on fuzzy logic. First, the speed of wind and height of wave in the bad weather conditions are fuzzified. Then, the collision risk indices are selected for fuzzy inference to get the basic collision risk which will be integrated with the vulnerability to collision accidents and it helps to improve the accuracy of collision risk assessment. According to the current multi-ships encounter situations, the similar cases are retrieved from the case database, and the collision avoidance decision is given after fuzzy adjustments. To implement collision avoidance actions, a fuzzy algorithm for nonlinear ship heading dynamic surface control (DSC) control considering input saturation and uncertainties is designed. The problem of “computational expansion” that may occur in high-order systems is avoided by using DSC technology. Finally, simulation experiments are implemented to verify the effectiveness of the collision avoidance method.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2023.3268123","Shandong Province Education Science Planning Innovative Literacy Special Project(grant numbers:2022CYB260); Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:52101375); Shandong Provincial Natural Science Foundation(grant numbers:ZR2021QG022,ZR2022ME087); Shandong Jiaotong University Ph.D. Startup Foundation of Scientific Research; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10103870","Collision avoidance;bad weather;fuzzy logic;multi-ships encounter;heading control","Marine vehicles;Collision avoidance;Indexes;Risk management;Fuzzy logic;Accidents;Navigation","","1","","30","CCBYNCND","18 Apr 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

We present a method for including target-provided measurements in said filter, both when using it to track extended objects and point targets. We use messages from the Automatic identification system as an example of target-provided measurements, and radar and LiDAR as examples of exteroceptive sensors. In the point target case, we utilize several different kinematic models in parallel through the interacting multiple models framework, and compare the presented method to several common trackers and other PMBM filter configurations. The results show that our method outperforms similar methods when target-provided measurements are available. The point target variant is also shown to work in a closed-loop collision avoidance experiment in a maritime environment, demonstrating its feasibility for use in real-world applications. For the extended object tracking case, we expand upon the Gaussian process PMBM filter. The extended object method is evaluated on both simulated and experimental data, and is shown to improve the tracking performance when including target-provided measurements in comparison to when it only uses exteroceptive measurements.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2024.3389824","Research Council of Norway under Project 309230 SFI Autoship and Project 295033 Autosit; DNV; Kongsberg; Maritime Robotics; European Union’s Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme under the Marie Skłodowska-Curie grant agreement No 955.768 (MSCA-ETN AUTOBarge); European Union from any liability.

"Research on Thrust Allocation for Power Positioning System Based on Improved Sparrow Search Algorithm With Multi-Strategy Fusion","Z. Wei; Z. He; B. Sun; Y.

First, the sparrow search algorithm is introduced. Aiming at its shortcomings in convergence speed, optimization accuracy and easy to fall into local optimality, a multi-strategy fusion improvement scheme including piecewise nonlinear dynamic random convergence factor strategy, warning position update condition and formula adjustment strategy, and golden sine perturbation strategy is proposed. Subsequently, the improved algorithm is applied to 12 benchmark functions with different characteristics and compared with Coati optimization algorithm (COA), whale optimization algorithm (WOA) and sparrow search algorithm (SSA). Experimental results show that ADGSSA outperforms the other three algorithms in optimization accuracy, convergence performance and stability. In the evaluation of 12 benchmark functions, ADGSSA demonstrates superior performance compared to SSA, WOA, and COA. Specifically, ADGSSA achieves the closest optimal value in 83% of the functions, provides the best average value in 85% of the functions, and has the lowest standard deviation in 75% of the functions. In the actual application of the thrust distribution system, ADGSSA shows significant advantages. Compared with WOA, the average power of the thruster is reduced by about 75%; compared with SSA, it is reduced by about 35%; compared with COA, it is reduced by about 17%. In addition, in 12 sets of thrust tests, the thruster wear of ADGSSA reached the smallest proportion of 82% among the four algorithms, which is significantly better than other algorithms. The test results and convergence curves further show that ADGSSA has significant effectiveness and superiority in improving the thrust distribution performance of the dynamic positioning system, proving the potential for promotion and application of multi-strategy fusion methods in control strategies.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2024.3471550","Innovation Project of the Offshore LNG Equipment Industry Chain(grant numbers:CBG3N21-2-7); High-Technology Ship Research Program(grant numbers:CBG3N21-3-3); New Technology Equipment for Rapid and 0067reen Elimination of COVID-19 Hydroxyl Radicals in Cold Chain Logistics(grant numbers:62127806); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10701277","Intelligent and practical dual-purpose vessels;ship power positioning;thrust distribution;spar search algorithm;multi-strategy fusion;intelligent optimization algorithms","Marine vehicles;Heuristic algorithms;Optimization;Training;Convergence;Resource management;Accuracy;Search problems;Perturbation methods;Safety","","","","22","CCBYNCND","1 Oct 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"
